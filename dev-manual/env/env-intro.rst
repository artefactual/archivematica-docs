Development environment
=======================

Archivematica's development environment and workflows are based on 
`Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/>`_. Docker 
Compose is the preferred environment for working with Archivematica's code. 
Compose can be used in a production environment, but installing Archivematica 
using Docker is not officially supported for production deployments. When installing
for production, Archivematica can be installed using packages or Ansible scripts 
in either CentOS/Red Hat or Ubuntu environments.

and Docker Compose, visit the `Artefactual Lab > AM Github repository <https://github.com/artefactual-labs/am/tree/master/compose#archivematica-on-docker-compose>`_.
