Ingest
======

During ingest, digital objects are packaged into SIPs and run through several
micro-services, including normalization, packaging into an AIP and generation of
a DIP.

If you would like to skip some of the default decision points or make preconfigured
choices for your desired workflow, see :ref:`User administration - Processing
configuration <dashboard-processing>`.

Should you run into an error during ingest, please see :ref:`Error handling <error-handling>`.

.. _create-sip:

Create a SIP
------------

#. Process transfers as described in :ref:`Transfers <transfer>`. If you selected
   "Create single SIP and continue processing" on the Transfer tab, your SIP has
   been created and Archivematica will begin running Ingest tasks. Click on the Ingest
   tab to continue working with your SIP.

#. The single SIP will move through a number of micro-services. If you have
   preconfigured Archivematica to do so, processing will stop at a decision point
   that allows you to choose a file identification method to base normalization
   upon or to choose to use pre-existing data gathered during identification at
   the transfer stage. Archivematica default is to use pre-existing data. For more
   about this option, see :ref:`Administer — Processing configuration <dashboard-processing>`.

#. Once the SIP reaches "Normalize", you will be given several options for how
   Archivematica should normalize the SIP. Choose the option most suitable for
   your workflow.

#. For selecting a normalization option, see :ref:`Normalization <normalize>`, below.


.. _arrange-sip:

Arrange a SIP from backlog
--------------------------

This section refers to the backlog arrangement feature on the ingest page, rather
than the Backlog tab. For more information on the Backlog tab, see :ref:`Backlog <backlog>`.

#. Select content from the backlog by either searching for it through the backlog
   search bars at the top of the Ingest tab or by browsing the backlog by clicking
   on the folder icons in the *Originals* pane. Note: Multi-item select is not
   yet included in this feature, though entire folders/directories can be moved.

   .. figure:: images/Ingest-panes.*

      :width: 100%
      :alt: Transfer backlog search showing population of the Originals pane

      Transfer backlog search results in populating Originals pane

#. Archivematica will display the directories available in Transfer backlog, including the
   number of objects in each directory. To hide directories from the Originals pane,
   click on the directory and click Hide.

#. Drag and drop the transfer directory(ies) and/or object(s) you wish to arrange
   from the Originals pane to the Arrange pane. By dragging and dropping, you can
   create an arrangement structure for your SIP. Note that all metadata, submission
   documentation, and other associated data is also copied to the arrange pane with
   your object(s). A copy also remains with anything you leave in the Originals pane.
   These files are hidden because they cannot be arranged independently of the objects
   to which they relate.

   .. note::

      In the above example, the Project.zip directory was dragged from the Originals pane
      to the Arrange pane. Note that the Project.zip directory in the Originals pane
      has been greyed out to indicate that the file has been added to a potential
      SIP.

#. Click on the directory in the Arrange pane to select, and then click Create SIP.
   Archivematica will confirm that you wish to create a SIP from the selected objects
   and then proceed through the ingest micro-services.

#. To arrange your SIP, create one or more directories in the Arrange pane by clicking
   *Add Directory*. You can create directories nested inside of each other. Note: You
   cannot rename a directory once you have created it; you must delete it and create
   a directory with a new name.

#. Click and drag files from the Originals pane into your desired directory in the
   arrange panel. You can move either individual files or entire directories. Note:
   All files must be in a directory inside of Arrange. “Arrange” cannot be used as
   the top directory.

#. When you have completed moving files and directories into the Arrange pane, select
   your desired top-level directory - this is the directory that will become
   your SIP. Click on Create SIP. Any files or directories which are not inside
   the directory you choose will remain in the Arrange pane until you create a SIP
   that includes these files and directories.

#. Archivematica will confirm that you wish to create a SIP and, after receiving
   confirmation, will proceed to the Ingest microservices.

.. _hierarchical-dip:

Arranging a SIP for AtoM
------------------------

If you plan to create a DIP to :ref:`Upload to AtoM <upload-atom>`, you may wish to add
levels of description to your directories and/or objects. Archivematica will add a logical
structMAP to the METS file, which AtoM will use to create information objects, applying the
chosen levels of description. Note that if you do not apply a level of description to a
digital object, AtoM will automatically assign it the level of "item".

This functionality is supported with AtoM 2.2 and higher.

#. Select a directory or object in the Arrange pane. Click *Edit metadata* to choose the
   level of description.

   .. image:: images/choose_lod.*
      :align: center
      :width: 80%

#. As you add levels of description they will be shown in the arrange pane for you
   to review before finalizing your SIP.

   .. image:: images/view_arrangement.*
      :align: center
      :width: 70%
      :alt: Viewing levels of description applied to SIP

.. note::

   To have the AtoM levels of description appear you must have entered your AtoM
   credentials in Administration. See :ref:`Administer, AtoM DIP upload <dashboard-atom>`.
   Levels of description in AtoM are managed as a taxonomy. To edit, see :ref:`Terms <atom:terms>`.

.. tip::

   If you choose not to assign levels of description to directories in SIP arrange,
   AtoM will flatten the DIP so that all digital objects are child-level descriptions
   of the target description.

.. _add-metadata:

Add metadata
------------

In Archivematica, metadata can be added either prior to the normalization step or after.
Archivematica will prompt you with a reminder to add metadata if desired during the
Process metadata directory micro-service. See :ref:`AtoM Dublin Core <atom:dc-template>`
for information about the Dublin Core elements available.

.. seealso::

    If you are importing lower-level metadata (i.e. metadata to be attached to
    subdirectories and files within a SIP) see also:

    * :ref:`Transfer <transfer>`

    * :ref:`Import metadata <import-metadata>`

   Core element and provide a link to `ISO 15836 Dublin Core Metadata Element Set <http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/>`_.
   Note that you can only add metadata at the aggregate level when using the template
   - that is, the metadata will be applied to each object in the SIP. If you would
   like to add metadata to a digital object, you must :ref:`Import metadata via CSV <import-metadata>`
   or add the metadata once the object has been uploaded to your access system.

.. _add-rights:

Add PREMIS rights
-----------------

Archivematica allows you to add PREMIS rights either prior to the normalization step or
after. Archivematica will prompt you with a reminder to add rights information
if desired during the Process metadata directory micro-service. For more information about the
PREMIS rights fields, see :ref:`PREMIS template <premis-template>`.

1. Click on the template icon.

6. Return to the ingest tab to continue processing the SIP.


.. _normalize:

Normalize
---------

Normalization is the process of converting an ingested digital object to a
preferred preservation and/or access format.

Note that the original objects are always kept along with their normalized
versions. For more information about Archivematica's preservation strategy, go
to the :ref:`Preservation Planning <preservation-planning>` section of the
manual.

1. At the normalization micro-service, the SIP will appear in the dashboard with
   a bell icon next to it. Select one of the normalization options from the
   Actions drop-down menu:

.. figure:: images/NormPresAccess1.*
   :align: right
   :figwidth: 50%
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Selecting a normalization option

   Selecting a normalization option

* **None** - the user is prompted for a decision.
* **Normalize for preservation and access** - creates preservation copies of the
  objects plus access copies which will be used to generate the DIP.
* **Normalize for preservation** - creates preservation copies only. No access
  copies are created and no DIP will be generated.
* **Normalize manually** - see :ref:`Manual Normalization <manual-norm>` for
  more information.
* **Do not normalize** - the AIP will contain originals only. No preservation or
  access copies are generated and no DIP will be generated.
* **Normalize service files preservation** - see :ref:`Digitization <digitized>`
  for more information.
* **Normalize for access** - the AIP will contain originals only. No preservation
  copies will be generated. Access copies will be created which will be used to
  generate the DIP.

Note that depending on the setup of your transfer, you may not see all of the
options listed above.

2. Once normalization is completed you can review the results in the normalization
   report. Click on the report icon next to the Actions drop-down menu.

.. figure:: images/ReportIcon1.*
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 80%
   :width: 100%

The report shows what has been normalized and what is already in an acceptable
preservation and access format:

.. image:: images/NormReport1.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Normalization report

3. You may review the normalization results in a new tab by clicking on Review.
   If your browser has plug-ins to view a file, you may open it in another tab by
   clicking on it. If you click on a file and your browser cannot open it, it
   will download locally so you can view it using the appropriate software on
   your machine.

   :align: center
   :figwidth: 80%
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Review normalization results in new tab

4. Approve normalization in the Actions drop-down menu to continue processing
   the SIP. You may also Reject the SIP or re-do normalization. If you see errors
   in normalization, follow the instructions in Error handling to learn more
   about the problem.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Manual normalization <manual-norm>`


.. _transcribe-contents:

Transcribe SIP contents
-----------------------

Archivematica gives users the option to Transcribe SIP contents using
`Tesseract <https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/>`_ OCR tool. If Yes is
selected by the user during this micro-service, an OCR file will be included in
the DIP and stored in the AIP.

.. note::

   This feature is designed to transcribe the text from single images (e.g.
   individual pages of a book scanned as image files). It does not support
   transcription of multi-page objects or word processing files, PDF files, etc.


.. _store-aip:

Store AIP
---------

1. After normalization is approved, the SIP runs through a number of micro-services,
   including processing of the submission documentation, generation of the METS file,
   indexing, generation of the DIP and packaging of the AIP.

.. figure:: images/StoreAIPUpDIP1.*
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 70%
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Archivematica ready to store AIP and upload DIP

   Archivematica ready to store the AIP and upload the DIP

2. If desired, review the contents of the AIP in another tab by clicking on Review.
   More information on Archivematica's AIP structure and the METS/PREMIS file is
   available in the Archivematica documentation: see :ref:`AIP structure <aip-structure>`.
   You can download the AIP at this stage by clicking on it.

3. From the Action dropdown menu, select "Store AIP" to move the AIP into archival
   storage. You can store an AIP in any number of preconfigured directories. For
   instructions to configure AIP storage locations, see :ref:`Administrator manual - Storage Service <storageService:administrators>`.

4. From the Action dropdown menu, select the AIP storage location from the
   pre-configured set of options.

.. note::

   We recommend storing the AIP before uploading the DIP. If there is a problem
   with the AIP at this point and the DIP has already been uploaded, you will have
   to delete the DIP from the upload location.

   For information on viewing and managing stored AIPs go to
   :ref:`Archival storage <archival-storage>`.

.. _upload-dip:

Upload DIP
----------

Archivematica supports DIP uploads to AtoM, ArchivesSpace, CONTENTdm and
Archivists' Toolkit. For information about uploading DIPs to your access system, see :ref:`Access <access>`.

.. _reingest:

Re-ingest AIP
-------------

There are three different types of AIP re-ingest:

1. Metadata only
++++++++++++++++

This method is for adding or updating descriptive and/or rights metadata. Doing
so will update the dmdSec of the AIP's METS file.  Note that the original
metadata will still be present but if you scroll down you'll also see another
dmdSec that says STATUS="updated", like so:

``<mets:dmdSec ID="dmdSec_792149" CREATED="2017-10-17T20:32:36" STATUS="updated">``

Choosing metadata only AIP re-ingest will take you back to the Ingest tab.

2. Partial re-ingest
++++++++++++++++++++

This method is typically used by institutions who want to create a DIP sometime
after they've made an AIP.  They can then send their DIP to their access system
or store it.

Choosing partial re-ingest will take you back to the Ingest tab.

3. Full re-ingest
+++++++++++++++++

This method is for institutions who want to be able to run all the major micro-services (including re-normalization for preservation if desired). A possible use case for full re-ingest might be that after a time new file characterization or validation tools have been developed and integrated with a future version of Archivematica. Running the micro-services with these updated tools will result in a updated and better AIP.

Full re-ingest can also be used to update the metadata, and re-normalize for access.

When performing full re-ingest, you will need to enter the name of the
processing configuration you wish to use. To add new processing configurations,
see :ref:`Processing configuration <dashboard-processing>`.

.. Important::

   The following workflows are **not** supported in full AIP re-ingest:

   * Examine contents if not performed on first ingest
   * Transfer structure report if not performed on first ingest
   * Extract packages in the AIP and then delete them
   * Send AIP to backlog for re-arrangement during re-ingest


Choosing full re-ingest will take you back to the Transfer tab.

How to tell in the METS file if an AIP has been re-ingested
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Look at the Header of the METS file, which will display a ``CREATEDATE`` and a
``LASTMODDATE``: ``<mets:metsHdr CREATEDATE="2017-10-17T20:29:21" LASTMODDATE="2017-10-17T20:32:36"/>``

2. You can also search for the reingest premis:event
``<premis:eventType>reingestion</premis:eventType>``

3. If you've updated the descriptive or rights metadata you will find an updated
dmdSec

``<mets:dmdSec ID="dmdSec_792149" CREATED="2017-10-17T20:32:36" STATUS="updated">``


.. _reingest-dashboard:

Where to start the re-ingest process
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can start the re-ingest process through the Archival Storage tab on the
Dashboard, the Storage Service, or the API.

Archival Storage tab on the Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to the Archival Storage tab and find the AIP you wish to re-ingest by searching
or browsing.

1. Click on the name of the AIP or View to open that AIP's view page. Under
Actions, click on Re-ingest.

.. image:: images/storage_reingest.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Click on reingest beside the AIP

2. Choose the type of re-ingest (metadata, partial or full).

.. image:: images/reingest_type.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Choose type of reingest and name of processing configuration

3. Click on Re-ingest. Archivematica will tell you that the AIP has been
   sent to the pipeline for re-ingest.

.. Note::

   If you attempt to re-ingest an AIP which is already in the process of being
   re-ingested in the pipeline, Archivematica will alert you with an error.

.. Note::

   Archivematica will appear to allow you to extract and then delete packages.
   However, the resulting AIP will still actually contain the packages, and in
   the METS file they will not have re-ingestion events correctly associated
   with them. This is documented as a bug here:
   https://projects.artefactual.com/issues/10699

4. Proceed to the Transfer or Ingest tab and approve the AIP re-ingest.

.. image:: images/reingest_approve.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Approve AIP reingest in Ingest tab.


5. At the Normalization micro-service you will make different choices depending
   on the type of AIP re-ingest you've selected.

   **Metadata-only re-ingest**

   1. Add or update your metadata *before* you approve Normalization to ensure
      the metadata is written to the database, which means it will be written to
      the AIP METS file. There are two ways to add or update metadata:

      A. Add metadata directly into Archivematica

         a. Click on the paper and pencil icon on the same line as the name of
            the SIP to take you to the "Add metadata" page.

         b. Click "Add" under "Rights" if you have rights-related metadata to add.

         c. Click on "Add" under "Metadata" if you have descriptive metadata to add.

         d. Enter your metadata.

         e. Click on "Ingest" (top left corner) to go back to the Ingest tab
            when you're done.

      B. Add metadata files

         a. Click on the metadata report icon on the same line as the name of
            the SIP to take you to the "Add metadata" page.

         b. Click on "Add metadata files" under "Metadata"

         c. Click on "Browse"

         d. Select a ``metadata.csv`` file.  Note name of the file must be
            exactly ``metadata.csv`` and the file must follow the structure
            outlined in :ref:`Import metadata <import-metadata>`.  The file must
            also be staged in the same Transfer Source location that you stage
            your objects for transfer to Archivematica.

   2. Select "Do not normalize" when you have finished adding your metadata.

   3. Continue processing the SIP as normal.

.. Note::

   When performing a metadata-only re-ingest, there will be no objects
   in your AIP in the review stage- Archivematica replaces the METS file in the
   existing AIP upon storage.

   **Partial re-ingest**

   1. Add metadata if desired. See **Metadata-only re-ingest** for instructions

   2. Select "Normalize for access".

   3. Continue processing the SIP as normal.


   **Full re-ingest**

   1. Add metadata if desired. See **Metadata-only re-ingest** for instructions.

   2. Select the normalization path of your choosing.

   3. Continue processing the SIP as normal.


.. important::

   All normalization options will appear as for any SIP being normalized, but
   when performing metadata only or partial re-ingest, **only** the normalization
   paths noted above are supported.

.. tip::

   You can add or update the metadata either before or after Normalization, but to
   ensure the metadata is written to the database before the AIP METS
   is prepared, it is recommended practice to add the metadata before
   Normalization, or set the metadata reminder to unchecked in Processing
   Configuration.

.. _re-ingest-storage-service:

Storage Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. From the Packages tab in the Storage Service, click on Re-ingest beside the
   AIP you wish to reingest.

.. image:: images/reingest_ss.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Reingest link in Storage Service Packages tab

2. The Storage Service will ask you to choose a pipeline, the types of reingest
   (see above for thorough descriptions of each), and for full re-ingest, the
   name of the processing configuration.

.. image:: images/reingest_ss_2.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Screen to choose pipeline and type of reingest

3. The Storage Service will confirm that the AIP has been sent to the pipeline
   for reingest. Proceed to the Transfer or Ingest tab of your pipeline, and follow
   steps 3-6 above.

.. _cleanup-ingest:

Clean up the ingest dashboard
-----------------------------

The dashboard in the Ingest tab should be cleaned up from time to time. As the
list of SIPs grows, it takes Archivematica longer and longer to parse this
information which can create browser timeout issues.

.. NOTE::
   This does not delete the SIP or related entities. It merely removes them
   from the dashboard.

Remove a single ingest
++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Ensure that the SIP you want to remove doesn't require any user input.
   You must complete all user inputs and either complete the SIP (i.e.
   AIPs/DIPs are created and stored/uploaded) or reject the SIP before it can be
   removed from the dashboard.

#. When you are ready to remove a SIP from the dashboard, click the red circle
   icon found next to the add metadata icon, to the right of the SIP name.

#. Click the Confirm button to remove the SIP from the dashboard.


Remove all completed ingests
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Ensure that the SIPs you want to remove are complete (i.e. AIPs/DIPs are
   created and stored/uploaded). Note that this feature only works on completed SIPs;
   rejected SIPs will have to be removed one at a time.

#. When you are ready to remove all completed SIPs, click the red circle
   icon in the table header of the list of SIPs.

#. Click the Confirm button to remove all completed SIPs from the dashboard.
