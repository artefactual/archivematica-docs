.. _dashboard-processing:

Processing configuration
------------------------

The processing configuration administration page of the dashboard allows users
to configure the job decision points presented by Archivematica during transfer
and ingest. This screen provides you with an easy form to configure the default
processingMCP.xml that governs these decisions. When you change the options
using the web interface the necessary XML will be written behind the scenes.

Starting in 1.7, Archivematica includes both a default and an automated
processing configuration. The automated processing configuration is used only if
a transfer source location has been set up to move content through Archivematica
with no human operator.

.. image:: images/ProcessingConfigOptions.*
   :align: center
   :width: 60%
   :alt: Processing configuration selection screen, showing three config options: automated, borndigital, and default

Multiple processing configurations can be created using the *Add* button on the
Processing Configuration screen. Often, users create multiple configurations for
different types of content - one for audio-visual material, one for images, one
for textual records, etc. To edit an existing processing configuration file,
click on the *Edit* button to the right of the processing configuration name.

Note that alternate processing configurations (i.e. anything other than default)
are used in two ways:

#. When you reingest an AIP, you are given the opportunity to select which
   processing configuration you'd like to use.
#. You can download a specific processingMCP.xml via the command line and
   include it with a transfer. Archivematica will then use this to
   automate your transfer selections, rather than the default configuration. For
   more information on the processingMCP.xml file, see :ref:`Creating a custom
   config with processingMCP.xml <processingmcp-file>`.

All other transfers will use the default processing configuration.

In order to edit any of the selections, select a choice from the drop-down menu
to the right of the job name. Once you've made all of your selections, save the
processing configuration. The fields are described in the next section.

Storage Service options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is where you'll find the complete URL for the Storage Service, along with a
username and API key. See the Storage Service documentation for more information
about this feature.

Checksum algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can select which checksum algorithm Archivematica will use during the
*Assign UUIDs and checksums* micro-service in Transfer. Choose between MD5,
SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512.

Elasticsearch indexing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of Archivematica 1.7, Elasticsearch is optional. Installing Archivematica
without Elasticsearch means reduced consumption of compute resources and lower
operational complexity. Disabling Elasticsearch means that the Backlog,
Appraisal, and Archival Storage tabs do not appear and their functionality is
not available.

This section in the General configuration shows if Elasticsearch is enabled or
disabled.

.. _dashboard-failures:

Failures
--------

This page displays packages that failed during processing.

   :width: 70%
   :alt: Failure report for a failed transfer

The failure report can be removed from the Dashboard by clicking Delete.

.. _dashboard-transfer-source:

Transfer source location
------------------------

Archivematica allows you to start transfers using the operating system's file
browser or via a web interface. Source files for transfers, however, cannot be
uploaded using the web interface; they must exist on volumes accessible to the
Archivematica MCP server and configured via the Storage Service.

When starting a transfer you are required to select one or more directories of
files to add to the transfer.

.. _dashboard-AIP-stor:

AIP storage locations
---------------------

AIP storage directories are directories in which completed AIPs are stored.
Storage directories can be specified in a manner similar to transfer source
directories using the Storage Service.

You can view your transfer source directories in the Administrative tab of the
dashboard under "AIP storage locations".

.. _dashboard-usage:

Processing storage usage
------------------------

This section of the Administration page displays various processing locations
with their current usage of available space.

.. image:: images/ProcessingUsage.*

   :width: 80%
   :alt: Processing storage usage area of Administration page

Administrators can use the "clear" buttons to delete the contents of these
processing locations to make more room on their server.

.. _dashboard-dip-upload:

DIP upload
----------

Archivematica has access integrations with three access platforms: AtoM,
ArchivesSpace, and Archivists' Toolkit.

.. _dashboard-atom:

AtoM DIP upload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Archivematica can upload DIPs directly to an `AtoM`_ website so that the
contents can be accessed online. The AtoM DIP upload configuration page is where
you specify the AtoM installation where you'd like to upload DIPs (and, if you
are using Rsync to transfer the DIP files, the Rsync transfer details).

For more information on configuring the AtoM DIP upload parameters and the
servers, please see the Admin Manual :ref:`AtoM DIP upload
<admin-dashboard-atom>` configuration instructions.

**Levels of description**

You can fetch levels of description from AtoM so that they can be used in
:ref:`SIP arrange <arrange-sip>`. Click on Levels of Description, then
Fetch from AtoM to get an updated list from the AtoM levels of description
taxonomy.

.. image:: images/AtoM_lod.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Levels of description from AtoM shown in Archivematica administration screen

If there are levels of description in the AtoM taxonomy that you prefer not to
use in Archivematica SIP arrange, you can remove them using the red delete
button. You can change the order that they appear in SIP arrange by using the
up/down arrows in this screen.

.. note::

   You may need an administrator to configure AtoM for DIP uploads from
   Archivematica. For administrator instructions, see :ref:`AtoM DIP upload
   <admin-dashboard-atom>` in the Administrator manual

.. _dashboard-AS:

ArchivesSpace DIP upload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before ingesting digital objects destined for ArchivesSpace, ensure that
the ArchivesSpace DIP upload settings in the administration tab of the
dashboard have been set.

For more information on configuring the ArchivesSpace DIP upload parameters,
please see the Admin Manual :ref:`ArchivesSpace DIP upload <admin-dashboard-AS>`
configuration instructions.

.. _dashboard-AT:

Archivists Toolkit DIP upload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before ingesting digital objects destined for Archivists' Toolkit, ensure that
the Achivists' Toolkit DIP upload settings in the administration tab of the
dashboard have been set.

Should you wish to enable the PREMIS-based restrictions functionality, choose
*base on PREMIS* under **Restrictions Apply**. To add PREMIS rights, please see
:ref:`Add PREMIS rights and restrictions <at-premis>`.

For more information on configuring the Archivists' Toolkit DIP upload
parameters, please see the Admin Manual :ref:`Archivists' Toolkit DIP upload
<admin-dashboard-AT>` configuration instructions.

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`Archivists Toolkit <archivists-toolkit>`

.. important::

   We no longer actively test DIP uploads to Archivists' Toolkit.

.. _dashboard-premis:

PREMIS agent
------------

The PREMIS agent name and code can be set via the administration interface.

.. image:: images/PREMISAdmin.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: PREMIS agent settings in Administration tab

The PREMIS agent information is used in the METS files created by Archivematica
to identify the agency performing the digital preservation events.

.. _dashboard-rest:

REST API
--------

Archivematica includes a REST API for automating transfer approval.
Artefactual recommends that a technical administrator configure the options
for this feature.

To configure Archivematica to use the REST API for automation, see
:ref:`Administrator manual - REST API <admin-dashboard-rest>`.

.. _dashboard-users:

Users
-----

The dashboard provides a simple cookie-based user authentication system using
the `Django authentication framework`_. Access to the dashboard is limited only
to logged-in users and a login page will be shown when the user is not
recognized. If the application can't find any user in the database, the user
creation page will be shown instead, allowing the creation of an administrator
account.

Users can be also created, modified and deleted from the Administration tab.
Only users who are administrators can create and edit user accounts.

You can add a new user to the system by clicking the "Add new" button on the
user administration page. By adding a user you provide a way to access
Archivematica using a username/password combination. Should you need to change
a user's username or password, you can do so by clicking the "Edit" button,
corresponding to the user, on the administration page. Should you need to
revoke a user's access, you can click the corresponding "Delete" button.

For more information about user creation, deletion, and security, please see
the :ref:`Users <admin-dashboard-users>` section in the Admin Manual.

.. _handle-server:

Handle Server config
--------------------
Archivematica can to be configured to make requests to a Handle System HTTP API
so that files, directories and entire AIPs can be assigned persistent
identifiers (PIDS) and derived persistent URLs (PURLs).

.. _language-choice:

Language
--------
The Archivematica dashboard is in the process of being translated. For more
information, see :ref:`Translations <translations>`.
