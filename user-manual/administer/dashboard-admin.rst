Processing configuration
------------------------

.. image:: images/ProcessingConfig.*
   :align: right
   :width: 60%
   :alt: Processing configuration screen in the dashboard

The processing configuration administration page of the dashboard allows users
to configure the job decision points presented by Archivematica during transfer and
ingest. This screen provides you with an easy form to configure the default
processingMCP.xml that governs these decisions. When you change the options using
the web interface the necessary XML will be written behind the scenes.

Starting in 1.7, Archivematica includes both a default and an automated
processing configuration. The automated processing configuration is used only if
a transfer source location has been set up to move content through Archivematica
with no human operator.

Multiple processing configurations can be created using the *Add* button on the
Processing Configuration screen. Often, users create multiple configurations for
different types of content - one for audio-visual material, one for images, one
for textual records, etc. To edit an existing processing configuration file, click
on the *Edit* button to the right of the processing configuration name.

In order to edit any of the selections, select a choice from the drop-down menu
to the right of the job name. Once you've made all of your selections, save the
processing configuration.

Processing configuration fields
===============================

Many jobs in the Archivematica transfer and ingest tabs have configurable decision
points. Automating these decisions can make the transfer and ingest process substantially
quicker, especially if you find yourself selecting the same decisions over and over.
Below is a list of the processing configuration form fields with a short description
about how they work.

.. note::

  Selecting *None* means that Archivematica will prompt you to make the decision
  as the transfer/ingest is being processed.

#. **Name**: The name of the processingMCP.xml file that you are editing.

#. **Send transfer to quarantine**: Select whether or not to send transfers to
   quarantine.

#. **Remove from quarantine after (days)**: Indicate how long transfers should
   remain in quarantine. Once they are removed from quarantine, they will be
   available for continued processing. Note that this field will not be invoked
   unless the *Send transfer to quarantine* field is set to "Yes".

#. **Generate transfer structure report**: Select whether or not Archivematica
   should generate a directory tree of the original transfer and place it as a
   text file in the AIP.

#. **Select file format identification command (Transfer)**: Select the file format
   identification tool to be used on file format identification jobs in the transfer tab.

#. **Extract packages**: Select whether or not Archivematica should extract any packages
   included in the transfer (i.e. .zip files).

#. **Delete packages after extraction**: Select whether packages should be deleted
   after extraction. Note that this field will not be invoked unless the *Extract packages*
   field is set to "Yes".

#. **Perform policy checks on originals**: Select "Yes" if you plan to create
   policies using MediaConch or future validation tools as commands in the
   Format Policy Registry. You must also create rules based on the formats you
   want to check.

#. **Examine contents**: Select whether or not to run Bulk Extractor to generate
   content reports to identify personally identifying information (PII).

#. **Create SIP(s)**: Select if Archivematica should create one SIP from the transfer and
   continue processing or send the transfer to backlog.

#. **Select file format identification comment (Ingest)**: Select the file format
   identification tool to be used on file format identification jobs in the ingest tab.

#. **Normalize**: Select Normalization options (see :ref:`Normalize <normalize>`).

#. **Approve normalization**: Select whether or not to automatically approve normalization.

#. **Perform policy checks on preservation derivatives**: Select "Yes" if you plan to create
   policies using MediaConch or future validation tools as commands in the
   Format Policy Registry. You must also create rules based on the formats you
   want to check.

#. **Perform policy checks on access derivatives**: Select "Yes" if you plan to create
    policies using MediaConch or future validation tools as commands in the
    Format Policy Registry. You must also create rules based on the formats you
    want to check.

#. **Reminder: add metadata if desired**: Select whether or not Archivematica should
   remind the user to add metadata to the SIP using the GUI. Note: this job
   occurs at the last moment that it is possible to add metadata to the SIP; once the
   ingest proceeds past this point, it is no longer possible to add metadata to the SIP.

#. **Transcribe files (OCR)**: Select whether or not to transcribe the contents of
   the SIP (see :ref:`Transcribe SIP contents <transcribe-contents>`)

#. **Select file format identification command (Submission documentation & metadata)**: Select
   the file format identification tool to be used on submission documentation and
   metadata files.

#. **Select compression algorithm**: Select which tool you would like to use to
   compress your AIP.

#. **Select compression level**: Select how compressed you would like your AIP to
   be. Selecting a higher compression level means that the resulting AIP is smaller,
   but compression also takes longer. Lower compression levels mean quicker compression,
   but a larger AIP.

#. **Store AIP**: Store the AIP without interrupting the workflow in the dashboard.

#. **Store AIP location**: Select one archival storage location where you will
   consistently send your AIPs.

#. **Upload DIP**: Select an access system to send your DIPs or don't upload the DIP.

#. **Store DIP**: Choose to store or not store a DIP.

#. **Store DIP location**: Select one archival storage location where you will
   consistently send your DIPs, if you wish to store them.

.. _dashboard-transfer-source:

Transfer source location
------------------------

Archivematica allows you to start transfers using the operating system's file
browser or via a web interface. Source files for transfers, however, cannot be
uploaded using the web interface; they must exist on volumes accessible to the
Archivematica MCP server and configured via the Storage Service.

When starting a transfer you are required to select one or more directories of
files to add to the transfer.


.. _dashboard-AIP-stor:

AIP storage locations
---------------------

AIP storage directories are directories in which completed AIPs are stored.
Storage directories can be specified in a manner similar to transfer source
directories using the Storage Service.

You can view your transfer source directories in the Administrative tab of the
dashboard under "AIP storage locations".

.. _dashboard-usage:

Processing storage usage
------------------------

This section of the Administration page displays various processing locations
with their current usage of available space.

processing locations to make more room on their server.

.. _dashboard-atom:

AtoM DIP upload
---------------

Archivematica can upload DIPs directly to an
`AtoM <www.accesstomemory.org>`_ website so that the contents can
be accessed online. The AtoM DIP upload configuration page is where you
specify the AtoM installation where you'd like to upload DIPs
(and, if you are using Rsync to transfer the DIP files, the Rsync transfer details).

* **Login password** : the password used to log in to AtoM.

* **AtoM version** : the version of the destination AtoM website (find in Admin -> Settings -> Global).

.. note::

   Archivematica 1.5 has been tested with and is recommended for use with AtoM 2.2
   and AtoM 2.3.

If you are using Rsync to send the DIP to AtoM, enter Rsync details:

* **Rsync target** : Destination value for rsync, e.g. ``foobar.com:/dips``

* **Rsync command** : Used to specify the remote shell manually, e.g. ``ssh -p 22222 -l user``

If you are not using Rsync, leave these fields blank.

If you would like to have additional details in failure reports, also enable debug mode by choosing
"Yes".

**AtoM user interface**

In the AtoM user interface, please take note of the following:

* The sword plugin (Admin --> Plugins --> qtSwordPlugin) must be enabled in order for AtoM to receive uploaded DIPs.

* Enabling Job scheduling (Admin --> Settings --> Job scheduling) in version 2.1 or lower is also recommended.

**Levels of description**

You can fetch levels of description from AtoM so that they can be used in
:ref:`SIP arrange <arrange-sip>`. Click on Levels of Description, then
Fetch from AtoM to get an updated list from the AtoM levels of description
taxonomy.

   .. _dashboard-AS:

ArchivesSpace DIP upload
-----------------------------

.. image:: images/ASDIPConfig.*
   :align: right
   :width: 45%
   :alt: ArchivesSpace configuration settings

Before ingesting digital objects destined for ArchivesSpace, ensure that
the ArchivesSpace DIP upload settings in the administration tab of the
dashboard have been set.

* These settings should be created and saved before digital objects destined
  for upload to ArchivesSpace are processed. Note that these can be set
  once and used for processing any number of transfers (i.e. they do not need
  to be re-set for each transfer).

* Include the IP address of the host database (ArchivesSpace host), the database
  port (ArchivesSpace backend port), an ArchivesSpace administrative
  username, the ArchivesSpace administrative user password, and the Use Statement (see note below).

* Restrictions Apply: Selecting *Yes* will apply a blanket access restriction to all content
  uploaded from Archivematica to ArchivesSpace. Selecting *No* will send all content to
  ArchivesSpace without restrictions. Should you wish to enable the PREMIS-based restrictions functionality,
  choose "base on PREMIS" under "Restrictions Apply". To add PREMIS rights,
  please see :ref:`Add PREMIS rights and restrictions <at-premis>`.

* ArchivesSpace repository number: Insert the identifier for the ArchivesSpace repository
  to which you would like to upload DIPs here. Note that the default identifier for a
  single-repository ArchivesSpace instance is 2.

.. NOTE::

   The *Use statement* field is required. To populate this fields, you **must**
   refer to ArchivesSpace's Controlled Value Lists.

   The Use statement field in Archivematica is mapped to the Use Statement list in
   ArchivesSpace. If the uploaded materials are original master images, for example,
   you could enter ``image-master`` in the Use statement field to apply the label
   image-master to all of the uploads.

.. NOTE::

   The *Object type* field can be left blank. To populate this fields, you **must**
   refer to ArchivesSpace's Controlled Value Lists.

   The Object type field in Archivematica is mapped to the Digital Object Type list in
   ArchivesSpace. If the uploaded materials are sound recordings, you could enter ``sound_recording``
   in the Object type field to apply the label sound_recording to all of the uploads. For mixed
   media uploads, it is best to leave this field blank.

.. IMPORTANT::

   In order to save changes to the ArchivesSpace DIP upload configuration, you must
   enter the password before clicking save. Note that Archivematica will *not* show you
   an error if the password is not entered.


.. _dashboard-AT:

   :width: 45%
   :alt: Archivists Toolkit configuration settings

Before ingesting digital objects destined for Archivists' Toolkit, ensure that
the Achivists' Toolkit DIP upload settings in the administration tab of the
dashboard have been set.

* These settings should be created and saved before digital objects destined
  for upload to Archivists Toolkit are processed. Note that these can be set
  once and used for processing any number of transfers (i.e. they do not need
  to be re-set for each transfer). The screenshots below show the template in
  the dashboard.

* Include the IP address of the host database (db host), the database port (db
  port), the database name (db name), the database user (db user), and the
  Archivists' Toolkit user name (at username).

* Should you wish to enable the PREMIS-based restrictions functionality,
  choose "base on PREMIS" under "Restrictions Apply". To add PREMIS rights,
  please see :ref:`Add PREMIS rights and restrictions <at-premis>`.

   * :ref:`Administrators manual - PREMIS <admin-dashboard-premis>`

.. _dashboard-rest:

REST API
--------

Archivematica includes a REST API for automating transfer approval.
Artefactual recommends that a technical administrator configure the options
for this feature.

To configure Archivematica to use the REST API for automation, see
:ref:`Administrator manual - REST API <admin-dashboard-rest>`.

.. _dashboard-users:

Users
-----

The dashboard provides a simple cookie-based user authentication system using
the `Django authentication framework <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/auth/>`_.
Access to the dashboard is limited only to logged-in users and a login page
will be shown when the user is not recognized. If the application can't find
any user in the database, the user creation page will be shown instead,
allowing the creation of an administrator account.

Users can be also created, modified and deleted from the Administration tab.
Only users who are administrators can create and edit user accounts.

You can add a new user to the system by clicking the "Add new" button on the
user administration page. By adding a user you provide a way to access
Archivematica using a username/password combination. Should you need to change
a user's username or password, you can do so by clicking the "Edit" button,
corresponding to the user, on the administration page. Should you need to
