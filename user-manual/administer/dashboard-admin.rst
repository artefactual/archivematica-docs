   :alt: Processing configuration screen in the dashboard

The processing configuration administration page of the dashboard provides you
with an easy form to configure the default 'processingMCP.xml' that's added to
a SIP or transfer if it doesn't already contain one. When you change the
options using the web interface the necessary XML will be written behind the
scenes.

* For the approval (yes/no) steps, the user ticks the box on the left-hand side
  to make a choice. If the box is not ticked, the approval step will appear in
  the dashboard.

* For the other steps, if no actions are selected the choices appear in the
  dashboard

Specific processing configurations available on this page are:

#. Select whether or not to send transfers to quarantine (yes/no) and
   decide how long you'd like them to stay there (below).

#. Approve normalization, sending the AIP to storage, and uploading the
   DIP without interrupting the workflow in the dashboard.

#. Store the AIP without interripting the workflow in the dashboard.

#. Select whether or not Archivematica should transcribe files.

#. Select whether or not Archivematica should generate a transfer structure
   report (see :ref:`Process the transfer <process-transfer>`)

#. Select if Archivematica should create one SIP from the transfer and
   continue processing or send the transfer to backlog.

#. Select whether to extract packages as well as whether to keep and/or
   delete the extracted objects and/or the package itself.

#. Select Normalization options (see :ref:`Normalize <normalize>`).

#. Select whether or not Archivematica should remind you to add metadata at the
   appropriate point during ingest.

#. Select whether or not to Examine contents.

#. Select which format identification tool and command to run in both/either
   transfer and/or ingest to base your normalization upon.

#. Select which format identification tool and command to run for Submission
   documentation and metadata.

#. Select whether packages should be deleted after extraction.

#. Select between 7z using lzma and 7zip using bzip or parallel bzip2 algorithms
   for AIP compression.

#. Select compression levels:

    * 1 - fastest mode

    * 3 - fast compression mode

    * 5 - normal compression mode

    * 7 - maximum compression

    * 9 - ultra compression

#. Select one archival storage location where you will consistently send your
   AIPs and DIPs (if you are storing DIPs rather than sending them immediately
   to an access system.)

.. _dashboard-general:

   General configuration options in Administration tab of the dashboard

**Interface options**

Here, you can hide parts of the interface that you don't need to use. In
particular, you can hide CONTENTdm DIP upload link, AtoM DIP upload link and
DSpace transfer type.

**Storage Service options**

This is where you'll find the complete URL for the Storage Service. See
Storage Service for more information about this feature.

.. _dashboard-failures:

Failures
--------

This page displays packages that failed during processing.

.. figure:: images/FailuresAdmin.*

   Failures report in the dashboard


Clicking the date, name or UUID will display a report of the failure:

.. image:: images/FailReport.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: Failure report for a failed transfer

The Failure report can be removed from the Dashboard by clicking Delete.


.. _dashboard-transfer-source:

Transfer source location
------------------------

Archivematica allows you to start transfers using the operating system's file
browser or via a web interface. Source files for transfers, however, cannot be
uploaded using the web interface; they must exist on volumes accessible to the
Archivematica MCP server and configured via the Storage Service.

When starting a transfer you are required to select one or more directories of
files to add to the transfer.


.. _dashboard-AIP-stor:

AIP storage locations
---------------------

AIP storage directories are directories in which completed AIPs are stored.
Storage directories can be specified in a manner similar to transfer source
directories using the Storage Service.

You can view your transfer source directories in the Administrative tab of the
dashboard under "AIP storage locations".

.. _dashboard-usage:

Processing storage usage
------------------------

This section of the Administration page displays various processing locations
with their current usage of available space.

.. image:: images/ProcessingUsage.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Processing storage usage area of Administration page

Administrators can use the "clear" buttons to delete the contents of these
processing locations to make more room on their server.

.. _dashboard-atom:

AtoM DIP upload
---------------

Archivematica can upload DIPs directly to an
`AtoM <www.accesstomemory.org>`_ website so the contents can
be accessed online. The AtoM DIP upload configuration page is where you
specify the details of the AtoM installation you'd like the DIPs uploaded to
(and, if using Rsync to transfer the DIP files, Rsync transfer details).

.. figure:: images/AtoMDIPConfig.*
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 70%
   :width: 100%
   :alt: AtoM DIP upload configuration in Dashboard.

   AtoM DIP upload configuration in Dashboard.

The required parameters are:

 ``url``: the destination AtoM website's URL

 ``email``: the email address used to log in to AtoM

 ``password``: the password used to log in to AtoM.

 ``uuid``: Use this wildcard: %SIPUUID%. Archivematica will do the rest for you.

If using rsync to send the DIP to AtoM, enter

``--rsync-target="address.of.atom.machine:/tmp" \``

If you are using AtoM 2.0 or higher, enter

``--version=2``

Do not enter the specific version of AtoM, e.g. 2.0.1, only 2.

For additional details in failure reports, also enable debug mode:

``--debug``

To set any parameters for AtoM DIP upload change the values, preserving the
existing format they're specified in, in the "Arguments" field then
click "Save".

**In the AtoM user interface**

In the AtoM user interface, ensure that:

The sword plugin (Admin --> Plugins --> qtSwordPlugin) is be enabled in order
for AtoM to receive uploaded DIPs.

Enabling Job scheduling (Admin --> Settings --> Job scheduling) is also
recommended.

.. _dashboard-AT:

Archivists Toolkit DIP upload
-----------------------------

.. image:: images/ATDIPConfig.*
   :align: right
   :width: 45%
   :alt: Archivists Toolkit configuration settings

Before ingesting digital objects destined for Archivists' Toolkit, ensure that
the Achivists' Toolkit DIP upload settings in the administration tab of the
dashboard have been set.

* These settings should be created and saved before digital objects destined
  for upload to Archivists Toolkit are processed. Note that these can be set
  once and used for processing any number of transfers (i.e. they do not need
  to be re-set for each transfer). The screenshots below show the template in
  the dashboard.

* Include the IP address of the host database (db host), the database port (db
  port), the database name (db name), the database user (db user), and the
  Archivists' Toolkit user name (at username).

* Should you wish to enable the PREMIS-based restrictions functionality,
  choose "base on PREMIS" under "Restrictions Apply". To add PREMIS rights,
  please see :ref:`Add PREMIS rights and restrictions <at-premis>`.

.. _dashboard-premis:

PREMIS agent
------------

The PREMIS agent name and code can be set via the administration interface.

.. image:: images/PREMISAdmin.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: PREMIS agent settings in Administration tab

The PREMIS agent information is used in the METS files created by Archivematica
to identify the agency performing the digital preservation events.

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`Administrators manual - PREMIS <admin-dashboard-premis>`

.. _dashboard-rest:

REST API
--------

Archivematica includes a REST API for automating transfer approval.
Artefactual recommends that a technical administrator configure the options
for this feature.

To configure Archivematica to use the REST API for automation, see
:ref:`Administrator manual - REST API <admin-dashboard-rest>`.

.. _dashboard-users:

Users
-----

The dashboard provides a simple cookie-based user authentication system using
the `Django authentication framework <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/auth/>`_.
Access to the dashboard is limited only to logged-in users and a login page
will be shown when the user is not recognized. If the application can't find
any user in the database, the user creation page will be shown instead,
allowing the creation of an administrator account.

Users can be also created, modified and deleted from the Administration tab.
Only users who are administrators can create and edit user accounts.

You can add a new user to the system by clicking the "Add new" button on the
user administration page. By adding a user you provide a way to access
Archivematica using a username/password combination. Should you need to change
a user's username or password, you can do so by clicking the "Edit" button,
corresponding to the user, on the administration page. Should you need to
revoke a user's access, you can click the corresponding "Delete" button.
