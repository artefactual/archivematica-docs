What is Archivematica?
======================

Archivematica is a free and open-source digital preservation system that is
designed to maintain standards-based, long-term access to collections of
digital objects. Archivematica is packaged with the web-based content
management system AtoM for access to your digital objects.

Archivematica provides an integrated suite of free and open-source tools that
allows users to process digital objects from ingest to archival storage and
access in compliance with the `ISO-OAIS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System>`_
functional model and other digital preservation standards and best practices.
All of the Archivematica code is released under a

Lowering the barriers to best-practice digital preservation
-----------------------------------------------------------

The goal of the Archivematica project is to give archivists and librarians
with limited technical and financial capacity the tools, methodology and
confidence to begin preserving digital information today. The project has
conducted a thorough OAIS use case and process analysis to synthesize the
specific, concrete steps that must be carried out to comply with the OAIS
functional model from Ingest to Access. Through deployment experiences and
user feedback, the project has expanded even beyond OAIS to address analysis
and arrangement of transferred digital objects into SIPs and allow for
archival appraisal at multiple decision points. Wherever possible, these
requirements are assigned to software tools within the Archivematica system.
If it is not possible to automate these steps in the current system iteration,
they are incorporated and documented into a manual procedure to be carried out
by the end user. This ensures that the entire set of preservation requirements
is being carried out, even in the early, pre 1.0 system releases. In short,
the system is conceptualized as an integrated whole of technology, people and
procedures, not just a set of software tools. For institutions that want
technical assistance to install and customize Archivematica, optional
technical support services are provided by Artefactual Systems.

All of the software, documentation and development infrastructure are
available free of charge and released under AGPL and Creative Commons licenses
to give users the freedom to study, adapt and re-distribute these resources as
best suits them. Rather than spend precious funding on proprietary software
licenses that restrict these freedoms, the Archivematica project encourages
memory institutions tackling the challenges of digital preservation to pool
their financial and technical resources in projects like Archivematica to
maximize their long-term investments for the benefit of their colleagues,
users and professional community as a whole.
