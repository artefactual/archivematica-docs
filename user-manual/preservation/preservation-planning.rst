=====================
Preservation Planning
=====================

The Format Policy Registry (FPR) is a database which allows Archivematica users
to define which actions Archivematica should take on a particular file format -
for example, how Archivematica should normalize a JPEG file for long-term
preservation. This is called a format policy, and it defines the tools, rules,
and commands that Archivematica will use to complete the desired preservation
action.

Preservation actions such as normalization, package extraction,
characterization, validation, identification, verification, and transcription are
managed in Archivematica's Preservation Planning tab.

When you install Archivematica, default formats, rules and commands are
installed and accessed through the Preservation Planning tab. When you upgrade
to a new release of Archivematica, new formats, rules and commands may be added
(check the release notes for the specific release to find out). In addition,
you can maintain local rules to add new formats or customize the behaviour of
Archivematica. Your local changes are maintained if you upgrade your
Archivematica pipeline to a new version. Archivematica's default format policies
are maintained by Artefactual. Format policies will change as community
standards, practices and tools evolve. If you would like to suggest a different
default format policy, consider opening an issue in the
`Archivematica issues repo`_.

.. _pres-policies:

Preservation Planning policies
------------------------------

It is important for institutions to establish local policies and practices
that include monitoring the digital preservation environment to help inform
format normalization rules over time as standards and tools evolve.

We recommend documenting your policies and practices in accordance with the TRAC
standard for auditing Trusted Digital Repositories (`ISO 16363:2012`_).

.. _preservation-planning-formats:

Format
^^^^^^

A format is a standardized way that information is encoded for for storage on
a digital storage medium. Archivematica recognizes hundreds of file formats
by extracting format information from `PRONOM`_, a technical registry of file
formats maintained by the National Archives of the UK.

Selecting **Formats** at the top of the right-hand sidebar in the Preservation
Planning tab will take you to the formats view page, which displays a list of
all the formats that Archivematica currently knows about. Each entry in this
table is a record representing one or more related format versions. Each format
version is also a record. For example, the format record for *Graphics
Interchange Format* is comprised of format version records for various versions
of the GIF format: GIF 1987a, 1989a, and Generic gif.

You can add new formats to the FPR at any time by selecting **Create new
format** on the Formats view page. Note that new formats do not need to be
present in PRONOM; if you are dealing with extremely rare or one-off formats,
you can create a completely local format record here.

Fields:

* **Group**: see Format Group, below.
* **Description**: the name of the format.

Once you have created a format, you can add a format version to record more
precise details about the format.

Fields:

* **Description**: the name of the format version. This text will be used to
  specify the format type in the METS file. This field is required.
* **Version**: the version number for this specific format version. For example,
  for Adobe Illustrator 14 files, you could enter *14*. This field is required.
* **Pronom id**: the specific format version's unique identifier in PRONOM, if
  it exists. This field is optional.
* **Access format**: checking this box indicates that this format version is an
  acceptable access format for end users. This field is optional.
* **Preservation format**: checking this box indicates that this format version
  is an acceptable preservation format for long-term storage. This field is
  optional.

.. _preservation-planning-format-group:

Format group
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A format group is a convenient grouping of related file formats which share
common properties. For instance, the FPR includes an "Image (raster)" group
which contains format records for GIF, JPEG, and PNG. Each format can belong
to one format group.

Selecting **Groups** near the top of the right-hand sidebar in the Preservation
Planning tab will take you to the Format groups view page, which displays a list
of the format groups that Archivematica uses to categorize formats. Clicking on
a format name will display all of the formats belonging to that group.

The following format groups come pre-populated in the FPR:

* Audio
* Binary (Data)
* Binary (Executable)
* CAD
* Data Visualization
* Database
* Dataset
* Desktop Publishing
* Disk Image
* Email
* Flash
* Font
* GIS
* Image (Raster)
* Image (Vector)
* Package
* Portable Document Format
* Presentation
* Spreadsheet
* Statistics
* Text (Markup)
* Text (Plain)
* Text (Source Code)
* Test (Structured)
* Unknown
* Video
* Word Processing

Please note that a format group is manually assigned each time new data is
imported into Archivematica from PRONOM. If you think that a format has been
miscategorized, you can change it by editing the format. If you think that the
change is relevant to other users, consider opening an issue in the
`Archivematica issues repo`_.

.. _preservation-planning-purpose:

Purpose
^^^^^^^

Purpose refers to the function that a given tool, rule, or command fulfils
within an Archivematica workflow. This is dependent on the context in which the
tool, rule, or command is deployed. For example, a rule to normalize a JPG file
to TIFF using the tool convert might have the purpose *Preservation*, implying
that the purpose of this rule is to create the TIFF for long-term preservation.

The term Purpose is used in various places within the Preservation Planning tab.
Occasionally a similar term, like *Command usage*, is used instead.

.. _preservation-planning-tools:

Tools
^^^^^

Archivematica acts as a wrapper for many open source tools used to carry out
preservation actions. These include digital preservation specific tools like
`FITS`_, used for extracting technical metadata from files, as well as tools for
handling different file formats like `Inkscape`_, which is a design program used
to handle vector images.

The full list of tools can be accessed in the right-hand sidebar by selecting
**Tools** under the *Format policy registry* heading.

Tools are called by commands, and act on formats.

.. _preservation-planning-commands:

Commands
^^^^^^^^

Format policy commands are scripts or command line statements which control how
a tool runs. A command is created for a particular purpose, such as file
identification. For example, during the :ref:`Transfer <transfer>` process you
might tell Archivematica to identify your files using `Siegfried`_. This kicks
off the command "Identify using Siegfried", which runs the file identification
tool Siegfried the files included in the transfer. This command will be run once
on every file in the transfer.

To see the current commands for a particular purpose, find the purpose in the
right-hand sidebar (i.e. **Identification**) and select the sub-menu-item
**Commands**.

.. image:: images/identification-commands.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: The list of identification commands in Archivematica 1.7.2

Archivematica contains default commands for many different tools. You can
disable or replace these commands at any time.

.. _preservation-planning-rules:

Rules
^^^^^

Format policy rules associate commands to file formats. Like commands, rules are
created for a particular purpose, such as file normalization. For example, if
you are normalizing files for preservation, you can tell Archivematica to use
the command *Transcoding to jpg with convert* for all JPG files, while SVG files
are converted to PDFs using the command *Transcoding to pdf with inkscape*. In
this way, tools, rules, and commands all work together to implement preservation
policies.

To see the current rules for a particular purpose, find the purpose in the
right-hand sidebar (i.e. **Normalization**) and select the sub-menu-item
**Rules**.

.. image:: images/normalization-rules.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: The list of normalization rules in Archivematica 1.7.2

Archivematica contains default rules for many different commands. You can
disable or replace these rules at any time.

.. _altering-commands-rules:

Altering commands and rules
---------------------------

.. _writing-commands:

Writing commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Writing a command for Archivematica to use can vary widely, from adding one line
of bash to a few lines of Python to a full Unix script. As a result, the
expertise needed will vary depending on the context. Regardless of how complex
the script is, we recommend testing your script thoroughly before using it in
a production environment.

Further down on this page, there is information about each section of the
Preservation Planning ta, which contains specific information regarding the
commands for each section.

To add a new command, decide which purpose your command will fulfill (i.e.
Identification or Characterization). Then find the purpose in the right-hand
sidebar (i.e. **Characterization**) and select the sub-menu item **Commands**.
Once the Commands page is open, click on **Create new command**.

Fields:

* **The related tool**: the tool that this command will call.
* **Description**: a human-readable identifier for the command. This will be
  displayed to the user through the decision point drop down menu while
  processing material.
* **Command**: the script's source or the command line statement to execute.
* **Script type**: options are "Bash Script", "Python Script", "Command Line",
  and "No shebang". The first two options will have the appropriate shebang
  added as the first line before being executed directly. "No shebang" allows
  you to write a script in any language as long as the shebang is included as
  the first line.
* **The related output format**: the format that the command outputs. For
  example, if you are writing a command to normalize audio to MP3 using ffmpeg,
  select the appropriate MP3 format version from the dropdown. This field is
  optional.
* **Output location**: The path the normalized file will be written to. This
  field is optional.
* **Command usage**: the purpose of the command. This will be used by
  Archivematica to decide whether a command is appropriate to run in different
  circumstances.
* **The related verification command**: the command you would like to use to
  ensure that the output was created. This field is optional.
* **The related event detail command**: a related command that provides more
  information about the software running this command. This will be written to
  the METS file as the "event detail" property. This field is optional.

Commands created for the purpose of identification have slightly different field
options from other commands.

Fields:

* **The related tool**: the tool that this command will call.
* **Description**: a human-readable identifier for the command. This will be
  displayed to the user through the decision point drop down menu while
  processing material.
* **Configuration** (Identification commands only):
* **Script type**: options are "Bash Script", "Python Script", "Command Line",
  and "No shebang needed". The first two options will have the appropriate
  shebang added as the first line before being executed directly. "No shebang
  needed" allows you to write a script in any language as long as the shebang is
  included as the first line.
* **Script**: the script to be executed.

.. _changing-rules:

Changing rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To see the current rules for a particular purpose, find the purpose in the
right-hand sidebar (i.e. **Normalization**) and select the sub-menu-item
**Rules**.

Archivematica contains default rules for many different formats. You can disable
or replace these rules at any time. Note that the format and the command that
you wish to create the rule for must exist before you can create the rule.

When creating a format policy rule, the following mandatory fields must be
filled out:

* **Purpose**: the function of the rule within Archivematica. More information
  about the various purpose options can be found below.
* **Format**: the file format that this rule will act on.
* **Command**: the specific command to call when this rule is used.

You can also replace an existing rule by clicking on "Replace" beside the rule.
The revision history is tracked and can be viewed by clicking "View," and then
"Revision history."

.. _identification:

Identification
--------------

Identification is the process of analyzing given information about
a file to derive its format. Archivematica can do this either by looking at
the file extension of the file or by analyzing the file's signature, depending
on which tool is selected to perform the action. Archivematica can also be
configured to skip file identification, if required.

Identification tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Archivematica |version|, there are three file identification tools:

* `FIDO`_, developed and maintained by the Open Preservation Foundation,
  which identifies files by their signature and connects this to a PRONOM ID.
* File Extension, a simple script which identifies files by their file
  extension.
* `Siegfried`_, developed and maintained by Richard Lehane, which also
  identifies files by their signature and connects this to a PRONOM ID.

From the Preservation Planning tab you can customize the behaviour of the
existing tools or you can add new file identification tools.

.. image:: images/file-identification-tools.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: The list of file identification tools in Archivematica 1.7.2

Identification commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Identification commands contain the actual code that a tool will run when
identifying a file. This command will be run on every file in a transfer.

When coding a command, you should expect your script to take the path to the
file to be identifed as the first command line argument. When returning an
identification, the tool should print a single line containing only the
identifier, and should exit 0. Any informative, diagnostic, and error message
can be printed to stderr, where it will be visible to Archivematica users
monitoring tool results. On failure, the tool should exit non-zero.

Identification commands require some familiarity with Unix scripting.

An identification command runs once for every file in a transfer. It will be
passed a single argument (the path to the file to identify), and no switches.

On success, a command should:

* Print the identifier to stdout
* Exit 0

On failure, a command should:

* Print nothing to stdout
* Exit non-zero

Archivematica does not assign special significance to non-zero exit codes.

A command can print anything to stderr on success or error, but this is purely
informational - Archivematica won't do anything special with it. Anything
printed to stderr by the command will be shown to the user in the
Archivematica dashboard's detailed tool output page. You should print any
useful error output to stderr if identification fails, but you can also print
any useful extra information to stderr if identification succeeds.

Here's a Python script that identifies files by their file extension:

.. code:: python

   import os.path, sys
   (_, extension) = os.path.splitext(sys.argv[1])
   if len(extension) == 0:
           exit(1)
   else:
           print extension.lower()

Here's a more complex Python example, which uses
`Exiftool's <http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/>`_ XML output to
return the MIME type of a file:

.. code:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python

   from lxml import etree
   import subprocess
   import sys

   try:
       xml = subprocess.check_output(['exiftool', '-X', sys.argv[1]])
       doc = etree.fromstring(xml)
       print doc.find('.//{http://ns.exiftool.ca/File/1.0/}MIMEType').text
   except Exception as e:
       print >> sys.stderr, e
       exit(1)

Once you've written an identification command, you can register it in the FPR
using the following steps:

1. Navigate to the "Preservation Planning" tab in the Archivematica dashboard.
2. Navigate to the "Identification Tools" page, and click "Create New Tool".
3. Fill out the name of the tool and the version number of the tool in use. In
   our example, this would be "exiftool" and "9.37".
4. Click "Create".

Next, create a record for the command itself:

1. Click "Create New Command".
2. Select your tool from the "Tool" dropdown box.
3. Fill out the Identifier with text to describe to a user what this tool does.
   For instance, we might choose "Identify MIME-type using Exiftool".
4. Select the appropriate script type - in this case, "Python Script".
5. Enter the source code for your script in the "Command" box.
6. Click "Create Command".

Finally, you must create rules which associate the possible outputs of your
tool with the FPR's format records. This needs to be done once for every
supported format; we'll show it with MP3, as an example.

1. Navigate to the "Identification Rules" page, and click "Create New Rule".
2. Choose the appropriate format from the Format dropdown - in our case, "Audio:
   MPEG Audio: MPEG 1/2 Audio Layer 3".
3. Choose your command from the Command dropdown.
4. Enter the text your command will output when it identifies this format. For
   example, when our Exiftool command identifies an MP3 file, it will output
   "audio/mpeg".
5. Click "Create".

Once this is complete, any new transfers you create will be able to use your
new tool in the identification step.

For more information about writing a command, see :ref:`Writing commands
<writing-commands>` above.

Identification rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Identification rules allow you to define the relationship between the output
created by an identification tool, and one of the formats which exists in the
FPR. **Only create identification rules for formats being identified by
extension.** Both Fido and Siegfried identify files using their PUID. Because
PUIDs are universal, Archivematica will always look these up for you without
requiring any rules to be created, regardless of what tool is being used.

For more information about creating a rule, see :ref:`Changing rules
<changing-rules>` above.

.. _characterization:

Characterization
----------------

Characterization is the process of producing technical metadata for an object.
Archivematica's characterization aims both to document the object's significant
properties and to extract technical metadata contained within the object.

Characterization tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Archivematica has four characterization tools available upon installation. Which
tool will run on a given file depends on the type of file, as determined by
the identification tool.

The default characterization tool is FITS; it will be used if no specific
characterization rule exists for the file being scanned. It is possible to
create new default characterization commands, which can either replace FITS or
run alongside it on every file.

Depending on the type of the file being scanned, one or more of these tools may
be called instead of FITS.

* `FFprobe <FFprobe_>`_, a characterization tool built on top of the same core as
  FFmpeg, the normalization software used by Archivematica.

* `MediaInfo <MediaInfo_>`_, a characterization tool oriented towards audio and
  video data.

* `ExifTool <ExifTool_>`_, a characterization tool oriented towards still image
  data and extraction of embedded metadata.

* `fiwalk`_, a batch forensics analysis tool that is part of Sleuthkit.s

Characterization commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like an identification command, a characterization command is designed to run a
tool and produce output to standard out. Output from characterization commands
is expected to be valid XML, and will be included in the AIP's METS document
within the file's ``<objectCharacteristicsExtension>`` element.

When creating a characterization command, the ``output format`` should be set to
``XML 1.0``.

For more information about writing a command, see :ref:`Writing commands
<writing-commands>` above.

Characterization rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A characterization rule must be created to connect a characterizatio command to
a particular format. Note that formats that do not have a rule will be
characterized by FITS by default.

For more information about creating a rule, see :ref:`Changing rules
<changing-rules>` above.

.. _event-detail:

Event Detail
------------

Event detail ensures that information about the software running a command is
written to the METS file as the "event detail" property.

Event detail tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several different tools are used to write the event detail to the METS file,
depending on which event is taking place. For example, if FFmpeg is being used
to characterize a file, FFmpeg can write the event detail to the METS. In other
situations, the command line command `echo` is used to perform this function.

Event detail commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The commands describe the event detail output written to the METS file when
using various FPR commands; typically, the name and version of the tool being
used.

For more information about writing a command, see :ref:`Writing commands
<writing-commands>` above.

Event detail rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rules are not required for event detail, only commands.

.. _extraction:

Extraction
----------

During the transfer phase, Archivematica can extract the contents of a package
such as a ZIP file or a disk image. Archivematica comes with several predefined
rules to extract packages, which are fully customizeable by Archivematica
administrators.

Extraction tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Archivematica comes with three extraction tools:

* `7zip`_, used for most 7zip compatible formats
* unrar-free, used for RAR formats
* `Sleuthkit`_, used for many disk image formats

Extraction commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An extraction command is passed two arguments: the file to extract, and the
path to which the package should be extracted. Similar to normalization
commands, these arguments will be interpolated directly into ``bashScript`` and
``command`` scripts, and passed as positional arguments to ``pythonScript`` and
``asIs`` scripts.

.. csv-table::
   :file: _csv/extraction-command.csv
   :header-rows: 1

Here's a simple example of how to call an existing tool (7-zip) without any
extra logic:

.. code:: bash

   7z x -bd -o"%outputDirectory%" "%inputFile%"

For more information about writing a command, see :ref:`Writing commands
<writing-commands>` above.

Extraction rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An extraction rule must be created to associate an extraction command with a
package format.

For more information about creating a rule, see :ref:`Changing rules
<changing-rules>` above.

.. _normalization:

Normalization
-------------

Normalization is the process of taking a file of a given format and transforming
it into another format for a stated purpose, such as access or preservation -
for example, Archivematica could contain rules to convert a PNG file to a JPG
for  access and a TIFF for preservation.

Normalization is Archivematica's primary format preservation strategy. The
preservation copies are added to the AIP and the access copies are used to
generate a DIP for upload to the access system. Note that the original files are
always kept, to allow for different preservation actions in the future, such as
normalization to different archival formats or emulation.

Normalization tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several different tools are used to complete normalization tasks within
Archivematica, depending on the format of the file. For image files, ImageMagick
`convert`_ and `Inkscape`_ are commonly used; `ffmpeg`_ acts on audio-visual
files; `Ghostscript`_ and `ps2pdf`_ are used to transform materials to PDF. One
notable tool is an Archivematica-specific script that can transcode a maildir to
mbox format, used for emails.

Normalization commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Normalization commands are slightly more complicated than other kinds of
commands in the Preservation Planning tab because they take extra parameters.
The goal of a normalization command is to take an input file and make a copy of
the file in a new format. For instance, Archivematica provides commands to
transform video content into FFV1 for preservation, and into H.264 for access.

Archivematica provides several parameters specifying input and output
filenames and other useful information. Several of the most common are shown
in the examples below.

When writing a bash script or a command line command, you can reference the
variables directly in your code, like this:

.. code:: bash

   inkscape -z "%fileFullName%" --export-pdf="%outputDirectory%%prefix%%fileName%%postfix%.pdf"

When writing a script in Python or other languages, the values will be passed
to your script as command line options, which you will need to parse. The
following script provides an example using the argparse module that comes with
Python:

.. code:: python

   import argparse
   import subprocess

   parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()

   parser.add_argument('--file-full-name', dest='filename')
   parser.add_argument('--output-file-name', dest='output')
   parsed, _ = parser.parse_known_args()
   args = [
       'ffmpeg', '-vsync', 'passthrough',
       '-i', parsed.filename,
       '-map', '0:v', '-map', '0:a',
       '-vcodec', 'ffv1', '-g', '1',
       '-acodec', 'pcm_s16le',
       parsed.output+'.mkv'
   ]

   subprocess.call(args)

Once you've created a command, the process of registering it is similar to
creating a new identification tool. The following examples will use the Python
normalization script above.

First, create a new tool record:

1. Navigate to the "Preservation Planning" tab in the Archivematica dashboard.
2. Navigate to the "Identification Tools" page, and click "Create New Tool".
3. Fill out the name of the tool and the version number of the tool in use.
   In our example, this would be "exiftool" and "9.37".
4. Click "Create".

Next, create a record for your new command:

1. Click "Create New Tool Command".
2. Fill out the Description with text to describe to a user what this tool does.
   For instance, we might choose "Normalize to mkv using ffmpeg".
3. Enter the source for your command in the Command textbox.
4. Select the appropriate script type - in this case, "Python Script".
5. Select the appropriate output format from the dropdown. This indicates to
   Archivematica what kind of file this command will produce. In this case,
   choose "Video: Matroska: Generic MKV".
6. Enter the location the video will be saved to, using the script variables.
   You can usually use the ``%outputFileName%`` variable, and add the file
   extension - in this case ``%outputFileName%.mkv``
7. Select a verification command. Archivematica will try to use this tool to
   ensure that the file your command created works. Archivematica ships with
   two simple tools, which test whether the file exists and whether it's larger
   than 0 bytes, but you can create new commands that perform more complicated
   verifications.
8. Finally, choose a command to produce the "Event detail" text that will be
   written in the section of the METS file covering the normalization event.
   Archivematica already includes a suitable command for ffmpeg, but you can
   also create a custom command.
9. Click "Create command".

Finally, you must create rules which will associate your command with the
formats it should run on.

For more information about writing a command, see :ref:`Writing commands
<writing-commands>` above.

Normalization command variables and arguments
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following variables and arguments control the behaviour of format policy
command scripts.

.. csv-table::
   :file: _csv/normalization-command.csv
   :header-rows: 1

Normalization rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A normalization rule must be created to associate a normalization command with
a particular format. Normalization rules have three purposes: Access, for use in
the DIP, Preservation, for use in the AIP, and Thumbnail, for use in both the
AIP and DIP. You may only have one normalization rule per format per purpose -
for example, if you have a rule that states that PNGs are normalized to TIFF for
the purpose of preservation, you cannot have a second rule that states that
PNGs are normalized to GIF for the purpose of preservation.

You can decide whether or not normalization for thumbnails occurs for the
entire pipeline, rather than on a format-by-format basis, by altering the
:ref:`processing configuration <dashboard-processing>`.

The success rate of each normalization rule is show in the "Success" column on
the normalization rules page.

For more information about creating a rule, see :ref:`Changing rules
<changing-rules>` above.

.. _transcription:

Transcription
-------------

Transcription runs `Tesseract`_ or other transcription tools on image files to
analyze whether or not they contain text. If they do contain text, the text can
be read and output to a text file.

Transcription tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, Archivematica supports one transcription tool: `Tesseract`_, an open
source OCR tool.

Transcription commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, Archivematica supports one transcription command, which uses
the OCR tool `Tesseract <Tesseract_>`_.

Transcription commands are expected to write their data to disk inside the SIP.
For commands which perform OCR, metadata can be placed inside the
``metadata/OCRfiles`` directory inside the SIP; other kinds of transcription
should produce files within the ``metadata`` directory.

For example, the following bash script is used by Archivematica to transcribe
images using Tesseract:

.. code:: bash

   ocrfiles="%SIPObjectsDirectory%metadata/OCRfiles"
   test -d "$ocrfiles" || mkdir -p "$ocrfiles"

   tesseract %fileFullName% "$ocrfiles/%fileName%"

For more information about writing a command, see :ref:`Writing commands
<writing-commands>` above.

Transcription rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A transcription rule must be created to associate a transcription command with
a particular format.

For more information about creating a rule, see :ref:`Changing rules
<changing-rules>` above.

.. _validation:

Validation
----------

Format validation ensures that files are well-formed and compliant with any
relevant format specifications. In Archivematica, validation can also be done
against a custom policy that is applied to the format.

Validation tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Archivematica includes two validation tools: `JHOVE`_ and `MediaConch`_.
MediaConch was introduced in Archivematica 1.7 as a validation tool specifically
for Matroska (MKV) files, opening up the possibility to include more specialized
tools in future releases.

Validation commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three default validation commands in Archivematica |version|:

* Validate using JHOVE
* Validate using MediaConch
* Check against policy PLACEHOLDER_FOR_POLICY_FILE_NAME using MediaConch

MediaConch serves two functions: it can validate Matroska files against the
published specification for Matroska, and it can also validate many file formats
against an internal policy created by any institution. For more information
about creating a policy for policy validation, please see
`MediaConch workflow`_.

Validation rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default validation rule for most formats in Archivematica is to use JHOVE.
The exception is Matroska files, which use MediaConch by default as of
Archivematica 1.7.

If you would like to implement a MediaConch policy command, you must also create
a rule to invoke the policy checking command for the desired format. For
example, if you have created a MediaConch policy command to check against JPG
files, you must also create a rule that connects the format with the command.

Validation rules are called during several micro-services:

* During the *Validate* micro-service on the Transfer tab, which includes
  validating formats as well as checking original files against a policy.
* During the *Normalize* micro-service on the Ingest tab, where access and
  preservation derivatives generated during normalization are validated.
* During the *Policy checks for derivatives* micro-service on the Ingest tab,
  where access derivatives and preservation derivatives can be checked against
  a policy.

For more information about creating a rule, see :ref:`Changing rules
<changing-rules>` above.

.. _verification:

Verification
------------

Verification is automatically run after a normalization command. Archivematica
will run two commands: one checks if a file exists, and the other checks if the
file exists and is greater than 0 bytes in size.

Verification is run on the output of normalization, not on the original file.

You do not need to create rules for verification.
