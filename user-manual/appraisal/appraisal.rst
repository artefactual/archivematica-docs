Appraisal
======

The Appraisal tab provides a space between Transfer and Ingest for archivists to make decisions about what files from transfers should become SIPs and how these files should be arranged within the SIP. It includes features for examining the characteristics and contents of the files as well as for connecting files to finding aids created in ArchivesSpace. The Arrange a SIP from Backlog feature, found in previous versions of Archivematica, has also been moved to the Appraisal tab (see below Arrangement).

Tags that have already been created appear in the Tags drop-down menu. Filtering by a particular tag causes only files to which that tag has been applied to appear in transfers in the Backlog pane. Filters added in other panes in the Appraisal tab will also appear listed under the Tags drop-down menu. Filters can be removed by clicking the “x” next to them.

.. _analysis_pane:

=========
Analysis
=========

The analysis pane allows the user to explore files in transfers sent to the backlog. Files selected in the Backlog pane populate the Analysis pane and can be analyzed through four tabs: Objects, Tags, Examine Contents, and Preview File.

1) Objects
=========
In the Objects tab, information about selected files can be viewed in the form of a report or a visualization. The Report view provides information about the files’ format, PUID, group, number of files, and size. Files can also be analyzed through visualizations with options for representing the total number of files in each format and for representing the total size of files with each format represented in the list.
