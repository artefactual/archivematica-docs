=======================================
Archival Information Collections (AICs)
=======================================

Because datasets and digital object collections can be large and heterogeneous,
one dataset or collection of digital objects may be broken into multiple AIPs.
In such cases, these AIPs can be intellectually combined into one Archival
Information Collection (AIC), defined by the OAIS reference model as "an
Archival Information Package whose Content Information is an aggregation of
other Archival Information Packages." (OAIS, 1-9)

When you create an AIC in Archivematica, the individual AIPs are not physically
combined; that is, they still exist as separate packages. The AIC itself is also
a separate package, containing only metadata - specifically, a specialized METS
file that lists all of the AIPs that belong to the AIC.

Create an Archival Information Collection
-----------------------------------------

Creating an AIC is a two-step process. First, you must create your AIPs. It's
easiest if you are able to create all of the required AIPs before you create the
AIC, but there is information below on how to :ref:`update an AIC <update-aic>`
if needed.

The method below adds some metadata about the AIC (an identifier) to each
transfer before it becomes an AIP. This is optional, but it can be a helpful way
to search for the AIPs that will form the AIC. If you do not use the AIC
identifier, you must use some other method by which you can search for the AIPs
that will be included in the AIC (i.e. the AIP name). Note that if you do not
add an AIC identifier, it may be more difficult to :ref:`search <search-aic>`
for the AIC's component AIPs later.

The second step uses the AIC identifier (or some other search parameter) to
connect multiple AIPs into an AIC.

The method described requires users to enter the AIC identifier manually while
processing the transfer; however, it is also possible to add the AIC identifier
using a :ref:`metadata CSV <metadata.csv>` by adding a column to your CSV with
the heading ``dcterms.isPartOf``. With this method, you must append your
preferred identifier with "AIC#". This is automatically done when entering
data using the metadata form in Archivematica.

.. _aic-step-1:

Step 1: Create your AIPs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Create a :ref:`transfer <transfer>`. This transfer can consist of any data
   and may be created using any transfer type.

2. If you'd like, add an AIC identifier to the transfer by clicking on the
   transfer's metadata button. This must be done before ``Microservice:
   Add final metadata``.

.. image:: images/AIC-metadata-button.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Click on the metadata button to the right of the transfer name to edit the transfer's metadata

.. note::

   Archivematica can be configured to remind you to add metadata. In your
   :ref:`processing configuration <dashboard-processing>`, set the field
   ``Reminder: add metadata if desired`` to ``None``.

3. Clicking on the metadata button should have opened up the transfer's metadata
   information screen. Under the Metadata heading, click on **Add**.

.. image:: images/AIC-add-metadata.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Click on Add under Metadata

4. In the **Part of AIC** field, enter the AIC identifier. You can also add
   other descriptive metadata for the transfer, if you wish.

.. image:: images/AIC-add-identifier.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: On the add metadata screen, enter a value into the Part of AIC field.

.. tip::

   The AIC identifier can be any combination of letters and numbers.

5. At bottom of screen, click **Create**.

6. Finish processing your AIP and place it in storage.

Repeat steps 1 through 6 to create as many AIPs as you need. If you plan to use
the AIC identifier to connect your AIPs, make sure to enter the same number in
the **Part of AIC** field. Once you've created all your AIPs, move on to Step 2
and create the AIC.

.. _aic-step-2:

Step 2: Create the AIC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Once all your AIPs have been stored, click on the Archival Storage tab.

2. Search for the AIPs that will be included in the AIC. This is where the AIC
   identifier is helpful. To retrieve all AIPs with the same value in **Part of
   AIC**, enter ``AIC#[identifier]`` in the search box, replacing
   ``[identifier]`` with the identifier you entered. Select ``Part of AIC`` as
   the search parameter.

.. image:: images/AIC-search.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Search for AIPs in Archival storage

3. When you're satisfied that only the AIPs that you want to include in the AIC
   are included in the search results, click **Create an AIC**.

.. image:: images/AIC-create.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Click the Create an AIC button

4. You will see a metadata entry template for the AIC. At a minimum, you must
   give the AIC an identifier. Archivematica will use the identifier as the name
   of the AIC package that it is about to generate. You can also add more
   metadata about the AIC using this form, if you wish. When you're done, click
   on **Create** at the bottom of the metadata entry template.

.. image:: images/AIC-package-metadata.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Enter metadata about the AIC.

5. Navigate to the Ingest tab. The AIC will appear as a new ingest. Approve it.

.. image:: images/AIC-approve.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Approve the AIC in Ingest tab

6. Continue processing the AIC and place it in archival storage.

.. _search-aic:

Search for AICs
---------------

If you need to retrieve the AIC or any of the AIPs that make up the AIC, you
can do so on the Archival Storage tab.

To see AIC information while browsing the Archival Storage tab, check the
**Show AICs?** button next to the search button. Search results will now include
the column ``AIC``, which provides information about whether or not the AIP
is included in an AIC (or if it is, itself, an AIC).

.. image:: images/AIC-show.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: The AIC column shows the AIC identifier

In the above screenshot, note that four of the AIPs are part of an AIC while the
last result is the AIC itself. This was a wildcard search, displaying everything
currently in Archival Storage.

To search for the AIPs that belong to a specific AIC, enter ``AIC#[identifier]``
in the search box, replacing ``[identifier]`` with the identifier that you
entered while creating the AIPs (see :ref:`Step 1 <aic-step-1>`, above). Select
``Part of AIC`` as the search parameter.

.. image:: images/AIC-find-AIPs.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Search for AIPs in Archival storage

.. note::

   If you did not create your AIC by adding the AIC identifier to each AIP, as
   described in :ref:`Step 1 <aic-step-1>` above, it may be more difficult to
   find the AIC's component AIPs. You may need to download the AIC package and
   review the METS file contained within to see which AIPs make up the AIC.

You can search for a specific AIC by using the AIC identifier. Enter
``AIC#[identifier]`` in the search box, replacing ``[identifier]`` with the
identifier for your AIC. Select ``AIC identifier`` as the search parameter.

.. image:: images/AIC-find-by-identifier.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Search for AICs using the AIC identifier

If you want to see both the AIC and the AIPs that belong to it, you can perform
a Boolean search.

1. Search for the AIPs by entering ``AIC#[identifier]`` in the search box,
   replacing ``[identifier]`` with the identifier that you entered while
   creating the AIPs. Select ``Part of AIC`` as the search parameter.

2. Click **Add new** below the search box to add a second search query

3. Change the boolean operator to ``OR``.

4. In the second query line, enter ``AIC#[identifier]`` in the search box,
   replacing ``[identifier]`` with the identifier for your AIC. Select
   ``AIC identifier`` as the search parameter.

.. _update-aic:

Update an AIC
-------------

The most common reason to update an AIC is to add more AIPs to it. To do this,
the original AIC must be deleted and a new AIC created.

An AIC is deleted the same way that an AIP is deleted. For more information on
deleting an AIP, see :ref:`Delete an AIP <delete-aip>`.

To create a new AIC, follow the instructions to :ref:`create an AIC
<create-aic>` above.

.. _aic-contents:

AIC contents
------------

An AIC is a package, similar to an AIP, but it contains metadata only. A basic
AIC will have a structure similar to this::

  my_aic-ea0f2429-7d9f-49df-8e5a-2e6db0fb5fce/
    ├── bag-info.txt
    ├── bagit.txt
    ├── data
    │   ├── metadata
    │   │   └── METS.7a3a0b11-fbdd-484d-a58c-7d66273c3f23.xml
    │   └── METS.ea0f2429-7d9f-49df-8e5a-2e6db0fb5fce.xml
    ├── manifest-sha256.txt
    └── tagmanifest-md5.txt

Like AIPs, AICs are bagged according to the BagIt specification. To learn more
about how Archivematica implements BagIt, see :ref:`AIP structure
<aip-structure>`.

There are two METS files included in the AIC. The first one, in the ``data``
subdirectory, is the METS file for the AIC package itself, similar to an AIP
METS file.

The second METS file, located within ``data/metadata``, contains information
about the AIC and its component AIPs. The AIC's descriptive metadata section
(dmdSec) includes the Dublin Core added during AIC creation.

.. code:: xml

  <mets:dmdSec ID="dmdSec_1">
    <mets:mdWrap MDTYPE="DC">
      <mets:xmlData>
        <dcterms:dublincore xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xsi:schemaLocation="http://purl.org/dc/terms/ http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/qdc/2008/02/11/dcterms.xsd">
          <dc:title>My AIC</dc:title>
          <dc:type>Archival Information Collection</dc:type>
          <dc:identifier>AIC#1995-01-Council-Reports</dc:identifier>
          <dcterms:extent>3 AIPs</dcterms:extent>
        </dcterms:dublincore>
      </mets:xmlData>
    </mets:mdWrap>
  </mets:dmdSec>

The METS file also shows which AIPs are included in this AIC. The AIC's
component AIPs are listed in the METS file's fileSec.

.. code:: xml

  <mets:fileSec>
    <mets:fileGrp>
      <mets:file ID="aic-part2-d6fcffe4-5eef-4ae8-a0b8-b848ed7d7851"/>
      <mets:file ID="aic-part1-b7de7bb6-e263-4a6f-8ae6-d0c9bff04365"/>
      <mets:file ID="aic-part3-16f43cd7-4b2d-4a32-bee3-138adade4399"/>
    </mets:fileGrp>
  </mets:fileSec>

This information is also displayed in the logical structMap of the METS. The
logical structMap is a hierarchical display of the AIC, intended to show the
relationship between the items being described (i.e. that the component AIPs
are part of this AIC).

.. code:: xml

  <mets:structMap TYPE="logical">
    <mets:div TYPE="Archival Information Collection" DMDID="dmdSec_1">
      <mets:div LABEL="aic-part2">
        <mets:fptr FILEID="aic-part2-d6fcffe4-5eef-4ae8-a0b8-b848ed7d7851"/>
      </mets:div>
      <mets:div LABEL="aic-part1">
        <mets:fptr FILEID="aic-part1-b7de7bb6-e263-4a6f-8ae6-d0c9bff04365"/>
      </mets:div>
      <mets:div LABEL="aic-part3">
