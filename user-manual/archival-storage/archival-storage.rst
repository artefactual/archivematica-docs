Archival storage
================

During archival storage, the AIP is moved into its storage repository.

Should you run into an error during archival storage, please see
:ref:`Error handling <error-handling>`.

.. note::

   If you are running :ref:`Archivematica without Elasticsearch
   <install-elasticsearch>` or with limited Elasticsearch functionality, the
   Archival Storage tab may not appear in your dashboard.

.. _storing-aip:

Storing an AIP
--------------

#. Once ingest is complete, selecting a location to "Store AIP" in the Actions
   drop-down menu compresses and zips the AIP and moves it into Archival storage.

#. In the demo version of Archivematica the AIP storage directory is
   ``/sharedDirectoryStructure/www/AIPsStore/``. In other environments it can be a
   remote network mounted directory. If multiple AIP storage locations have been
   created in the Storage Service, each will appear in the Store AIP location
   dropdown, including LOCKSS locations.

#. The AIP directories are broken down into UUID quad directories for efficient
   storage and retrieval.

   .. note::

      Archivematica uses a directory tree structure to store AIPs. The tree is
      based on AIP UUIDs, which are 16-digit alphanumeric unique universal
      identifiers. Each UUID is broken down into a manageable 4-character chunk,
      or "UUID quad". Each quad represents a directory. The first four
      characters (the first UUID quad) of the AIP UUID will compose a
      subdirectory of the AIP storage. The second UUID quad will be the name of
      a sub directory of the first, and so on. The last four characters (the
      last UUID quad) are used to create the leaf of the AIP store directory
      tree, and the AIP with that UUID resides in that leaf.

#. The Archival storage tab in the Archivematica dashboard consists of a table
   with information about the stored AIPs. Use the up and down arrows in the
   column headers to sort by AIP name, size, UUID, date stored or status. Note
   that at the top of the table is the total size of the stored AIPs and the
   number of indexed files.

#. To open a copy of the AIP, click on the AIP name. You can then open or
   download the zipped AIP.

#. The AIP pointer file can be accessed by clicking on the Pointer file link.
   The pointer file provides information on the AIP and its relationships to the
   Archivematica, DIPs, and other AIPs as appropriate.

.. _aip-encryption:

AIP encryption
--------------

Beginning in the 1.7 version of Archivematica, institutions are able to encrypt
their AIPs for secure storage. This feature is particularly useful when an
institution stores its AIPs off-site.

To create an encrypted AIP, Archivematica needs an encrypted space and location
set up in the Storage Service. Please see :ref:`Encryption <storageservice:gpg>`
for more information.

#. Run your transfer through the regular microservices.

#. At the Store AIP location job on the Ingest tab, choose your encrypted AIP
   location. You now have an encrypted AIP!

You can tell if your AIP is encrypted on the Archival Storage tab. Encrypted
AIPs appear as True in the Encrypted column.

   .. image:: images/ArchiStorEncryptedColumn.*
      :align: center
      :width: 80%
      :alt: Archival storage tab showing encrypted AIP

The AIP pointer file contains a `PREMIS:EVENT` element for the encryption event.

The AIP itself can be downloaded in unencrypted form from the Archival Storage
tab.

.. _search-aip:

Searching the AIP store
-----------------------

To search the AIP index, use the search bar at the top of the screen on the
Archival Storage tab.

#. Use the first dropdown menu to select whether to search for the File UUID,
   File path, File extension, AIP UUID, or AIP name.

#. Use the second dropdown menu to select whether to search by keyword, phrase,
   or date range.

#. Select *Show files?* to display discrete files in your results.

#. Select *Show AICs?* to display Archival Information Collections (aggregates
   of multiple AIPs) in your results.

   .. image:: images/SearchArchStor.*
      :align: center
      :width: 80%
      :alt: AIP storage search results

The search index includes AIP names and METS contents. All METS metadata is
indexed and searchable.

Clicking on the name of an AIP will open the AIP information page. From this
page, it is possible to upload an associated DIP, re-ingest the AIP, or delete
the AIP as well as downloading the AIP or viewing the pointer file. Clicking on
the name of an image will open the image in the browser.

By clicking on "View raw" next to a search result, you can also view the raw
JSON data that contains the METS data, the Archivematica version that generated
the data, the AIP UUID, the time indexing occurred, and the relative file path
within the AIP.

.. _delete-aip:

Deleting an AIP
---------------

#. To request AIP deletion, click on the name of the AIP to open the AIP
   information page.

#. In the Actions section at the bottom of the page, select *Delete*.

   .. image:: images/DeleteButton.*
      :align: center
      :width: 80%
      :alt:  Dashboard request to delete AIP

#. To delete the AIP, you must enter the UUID. Archivematica will also ask for a
   reason for deletion.

   .. image:: images/ReasonDelete.*
      :align: center
      :width: 80%
      :alt: Give a reason for deletion

#. Click delete. When you refresh the Archival Storage tab, the status of your
   AIP should now read *Deletion requested*.

Choosing to delete an AIP will send a request to your Archival Storage Service
administrator. If the administrator approves the request, your AIP will be
deleted from your Archival Storage and your index will be updated. If the
administrator denies the request, the AIP will remain in storage and your
administrator should contact you.

.. important::

   Note that Archivematica tracks the location and existence
   of AIPs in 2 ways: within the Storage Service and in the Elastic Search index
   which you can search via the dashboard. Deleting AIPs directly from the file
   system rather than through the Storage Service will cause inconsistencies in
   both applications and is not recommended in a production environment.
