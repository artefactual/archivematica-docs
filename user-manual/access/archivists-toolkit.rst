==========================================
Upload DIP metadata to Archivists' Toolkit
==========================================

This workflow involves:

* creating resource components in Archivists' Toolkit (AT);
* preserving digital objects and generating access copies (as DIPs) in
  Archivematica;
* sending DIP metadata, including digital object UUIDs, to AT;
* copying access copies to a web-server;
* and generating EAD files from AT and uploading them to a web-based access
  system.

Administrative settings
-----------------------

Before ingesting digital objects destined for Archivists' Toolkit, ensure that
the Achivists' Toolkit DIP upload settings in the administration tab of the
dashboard have been set.

* These settings should be created and saved before digital objects destined
  for upload to Archivists Toolkit are processed. Note that these can be set
  once and used for processing any number of transfers (i.e. they do not need
  to be re-set for each transfer). The screenshots below show the template in
  the dashboard.

* Include the IP address of the host database (db host), the database port (db
  port), the database name (db name), the database user (db user), and the
  Archivists' Toolkit user name (at username).

* Should you wish to enable the PREMIS-based restrictions functionality,
  choose "base on PREMIS" under "Restrictions Apply". To add PREMIS rights,
  please see :ref:`Add PREMIS rights and restrictions <at-premis>`, below.

Mapping Archivematica DIP objects to Archivists' Toolkit resource components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the DIP upload microservice in the Archivematica dashboard, the user can
choose to upload the DIP to AT. Archivematica then loads a screen listing all
AT collections. The user navigates to a specific collection either by
searching for it or by navigating to it using the screen pager. To start
mapping files in the DIP to resource components in a given collection, the
user clicks the “Assign objects” button to the right of the collection title.
To drill down to lower levels of the collection, the user clicks on the
collection title.

This opens the DIP object pairing screen which lists the objects in the DIP
and Resources in AT to which the objects can be linked:

.. image:: images/DIP_mapping1.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: DIP objects being mapped to archival descriptions from AT

The user selects one or more objects, then clicks on the appropriate resource.
This action highlights the resource; to pair the objects with their resources,
click on the “Pair” button on the top right of the screen or press Enter on your
keyboard:

.. image:: images/DIP_mapping2.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: DIP objects and descriptions already paired.

Note that an object that has already been paired with a resource is greyed out
and cannot be selected again, while a resource that has already been paired
with an object changes font colour from black to red, but can still have more
objects paired with it.

Above, shown are pairs that have been created using this process. To delete a
pair (i.e. make the digital object available to be linked to a different
description), click the delete icon to the right of the pair. Once the mapping
is completed, click “Save”. You will be asked to confirm the save, and then
the mapping screen will close and you will be returned to the ingest tab in
the Archivematica dashboard.

Workflow
--------

**Create resource components in Archivists' Toolkit**

Create a collection-level resource component and sub-components as desired.
Note that “level of description” of the top-level component must be
“collection”.

**Prepare transfers for ingest**

Digital objects can be ingested in zipped or unzipped bags or in unbagged
directories as standard transfers. If the objects are in a bag, do not insert
a directory between the top-level directory and the bag’s ``/data`` directory.

Thus:

.. code:: bash

   /bag
       /data
          file1.tif
          file2.tif
          file3.tif


Not:

.. code:: bash

   /bag
       /directory
           /data
               file1.tif
               file2.tif
               file3.tif


The directory structure above assumes that Archivematica will be generating
access copies during processing (i.e. user selects “Normalize for access” or
“Normalize for preservation and access” at the normalization step). If you
wish to include access derivatives in the transfer instead, the derivatives
must be placed in an /access directory, and must have the same filename as the
original so that Archivematica can recognize the link between the two.

Thus:

.. code:: bash

   file1.tif
   file2.tif
   file3.tif
   /access
      file2.jp2
      file3.jp2


For transfers with multiple images which are combined into multi-page access
copies, the directory structure should look like this:

.. code:: bash

   file1.tif
   file2.tif
   file3.tif
   multi.pdf
      /access
          multi.pdf

Note that this structure can also accommodate directory hierarchies:

.. code:: bash

   /access
       /JPG_PDF
           /GDH001_026_008800
               GDH001_027_008800.pdf
           /GDH001_027_00577
               GDH001_025_00577.pdf
       /JPG_PDF
           /GDH001_024_008800
               GDH001_024_008800_001_se.jpg
               GDH001_024_008800_002_se.jpg
           /GDH001_025_00577
               GDH001_02500577001_se.jpg
       /tiffs
           /GDH001_024_008800
               GDH001_024_008800_001_m.tiff
               GDH001_024_008800_002_m.tiff
           /GDH001_025_00577
               GDH001_02500577001_m.tiff

When processing transfers containing access derivatives, select either
“Normalize for preservation” or “No normalization” at the normalization step.

**Process transfers in Archivematica and send DIP metadata to Archivists Toolkit**

Process the transfer and create a DIP, either by placing access derivatives in
an ``/access`` directory in the transfer, or by selecting “Normalize for
access” at the normalization step during the Archivematica ingest workflow
(see Prepare transfers for ingest, above). At the “Upload DIP” step, select
“Upload to Archivists' Toolkit”. See :ref:`Administrative settings <at-admin>`,
above for information on administration tab settings for Archivists'
Toolkit and for using the digital object matching GUI to match DIP objects to
Archivists' Toolkit resource components.

Add PREMIS rights and restrictions
----------------------------------

Prior to normalization, the user can enter PREMIS rights information which can
be used to populate some fields in the AT database. Information about
Archivematica’s PREMIS rights module is available at
`PREMIS metadata: rights`_ .

This feature focuses on two acts to affect the AT DIP metadata (Disseminate
and Publish), and three different types of restrictions (Allow, Disallow and
Conditional). For Disseminate, the choices made affect whether the digital
object can be viewed by the public in the web-based access system. For
Publish, the only effect is that the PREMIS rightsGrantedNote is used to
populate the ConditionsGoverningUse field in the AT database. Below are
summaries of the logic applied to the information entered into the PREMIS rights
module.

**Act: Disseminate**


* If PREMIS <act> = Disseminate and PREMIS <restriction> = Allow:

   * restrictionsApply = FALSE (the public will be able to view the object in
     the web-based access system)

* If PREMIS <act> = Disseminate and PREMIS <restriction> = Conditional:

   * restrictionsApply = TRUE (the public will not be able to view the object
     in the web-based access system)

* If PREMIS <act> = Disseminate and PREMIS <restriction> = Disallow:

   * restrictionsApply = TRUE (the public will not be able to view the object
     in the web-based access system)

* If PREMIS <act> = Disseminate, populate AT ConditionsGoverningAccess with
  contents of PREMIS rightsGrantedNote

* When restrictionsApply=TRUE, both eadDaoActuate and eadDaoShow will be set to
  “none.”


**Act: Publish**

If PREMIS <act> = Publish, populate AT ConditionsGoverningUse with contents of
PREMIS rightsGrantedNote:
