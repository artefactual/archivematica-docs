Archivematica implements a microservice approach to digital preservation. The
Archivematica microservices are granular system tasks which operate on a
conceptual entity that is equivalent to an OAIS information package: Submission
Information Package (SIP), Archival Information Package (AIP), Dissemination
Information Package (DIP). The physical structure of an information package will
include files, checksums, logs, submission documentation, XML metadata, etc.

These information packages are processed using a series of microservices.
microservices are provided by a combination of Archivematica Python scripts and
one or more of the free, open-source :ref:`external tools <external-tools>`
bundled in the Archivematica system. Each microservice results in a success or
error state and the information package is processed accordingly by the next
microservice.

There are a variety of mechanisms used to connect the various microservices
together into complex, custom workflows, resulting in a complete ingest to
access system.

Archivematica implements a default ingest to access workflow that is compliant
with the ISO-OAIS functional model. Microservices can be distributed to
processing clusters for highly scalable configurations.
