What is Archivematica?
======================

Archivematica is a free and open-source digital preservation system that is
designed to maintain standards-based, long-term access to collections of
digital objects. Archivematica is packaged with the web-based content
management system AtoM for access to your digital objects.

Archivematica provides an integrated suite of free and open-source tools that
allows users to process digital objects from ingest to archival storage and
access in compliance with the `Open Archival Information System (OAIS)`_
functional model and other digital preservation standards and best practices.

All of the Archivematica code is released under a
`GNU Affero General Public License`_ and Archivematica documentation is released
under a `Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License`_.

Lowering the barriers to best-practice digital preservation
-----------------------------------------------------------

The goal of the Archivematica project is to give archivists and librarians with
limited technical and financial capacity the tools, methodology, and confidence
to begin preserving digital information today. The project has conducted a
thorough OAIS use case and process analysis to synthesize the specific, concrete
steps that must be carried out to comply with the OAIS functional model from
Ingest to Access. Through deployment experiences and user feedback, the project
has expanded beyond OAIS to address analysis and arrangement of transferred
digital objects into SIPs and allow for archival appraisal at multiple decision
points. Wherever possible, these requirements are assigned to software tools
within the Archivematica system. If it is not possible to automate these steps
in the current system iteration, they are incorporated and documented into a
manual procedure to be carried out by the end user. This ensures that the entire
set of preservation requirements is being carried out, even in the early,
pre-1.0 system releases. In short, the system is conceptualized as an integrated
whole of technology, people and procedures, not just a set of software tools.
For institutions that want technical assistance to install and customize
Archivematica, optional technical support services are provided by Artefactual
Systems.

All of the software, documentation and development infrastructure are
available free of charge and released under AGPL and Creative Commons licenses
to give users the freedom to study, adapt, and re-distribute these resources as
best suits them. Rather than spend precious funding on proprietary software
licenses that restrict these freedoms, the Archivematica project encourages
memory institutions tackling the challenges of digital preservation to pool
their financial and technical resources in projects like Archivematica to
maximize their long-term investments for the benefit of their colleagues,
users, and professional community as a whole.
