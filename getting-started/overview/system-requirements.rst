System requirements
===================

Browser compatibility
---------------------

Archivematica is tested most extensively in Firefox and Chrome. There have been
known issues in testing with Internet Explorer (see Bug
`#7246 <https://projects.artefactual.com/issues/7246>`_). Minimal, but successful,
testing has been done with Microsoft Edge.
