Drupal TRAC review tool
-----------------------

The review tool was developed by MIT in a project led by Nancy McGovern,
Director, Digital Preservation at MIT Libraries. Artefactual has
permission to host this tool for community use.
The copy provided here contains data about the TRAC requirements that Archivematica
fulfills for the repository.

Installation
------------

* Download link: https://www.archivematica.org/download/trac.tar.gz

Instructions for installation:

* Be sure to consult the README.txt and README_TRAC.txt files in the tarball
  prior to installation.

Summary
-------

The following text is slightly edited from the home page of the Drupal TRAC
Review site.

The home page of the site provides an overview of an organization's efforts to
document its evidence for meeting the requirements of the CCSDS Audit and
Certification of Trustworthy Digital Repositories
`checklist <http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/652x0m1.pdf>`_ that was
approved as ISO 16363 and is based on Trustworthy Repositories Audit and
Certification (TRAC): Criteria and Checklist that was released in January
2007. A TRAC review is a self-assessment method for an organization to
demonstrate good practice and conformance as a trusted digital repository to
its designated communities and prepare for a peer review or other external
audit. In many organizations, responsibilities for TRAC compliance are
distributed throughout the organization, with specific units and committees
having certain responsibilities for each requirement.

Responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each entity is assigned a role for each requirement using the RACI
responsibility assignment
`matrix <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix>`_.
The RACI Matrix describes participation by various organizational roles in
completing tasks for a project. RACI is especially useful in clarifying roles
in projects and processes requiring distributed responsibilities. See the
Responsibilities for TRAC page of the Drupal site for more information on RACI
responsibilities, and a listing of units and committees that have roles in
TRAC conformance.

In each requirement where Archivematica provides all or part of the evidence,
the Operations Group is identified as one of the Responsible parties. Other
organizational roles indicated are simply suggestions.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the site, each TRAC requirement has its own page. Sub- and Sub-sub
requirements are referred to on the relevant high-level requirement page.
Current compliance with TRAC requirements is assessed on a rating system from
0 to 4 (see example:
`SGDS report <http://206.191.128.204/trac/sites/default/files/SGDS%202009-9421%20%28D.%20BOUCON%29.pdf>`_,
page 14):

*  4 = fully compliant - the repository can demonstrate that has
   comprehensively addressed the requirement

*  3 = mostly compliant - the repository can demonstrate that it has mostly
   addressed the requirement and is on working on full compliance

*  2 = half compliant - the repository has partially addressed the requirement
   and has significant work remaining to fully address the requirement

*  1 = slightly compliant - the repository has something in place, but has a
   lot of work to do in addressing the requirement

*  0 = non-compliant or not started - the repository has not yet addressed the
   requirement or has not started the review of the requirement

Any group in the organization that is involved in defining policy and practice
should update the status of relevant requirements. When listing evidence,
please include sufficient information for reviewers to get to the cited
evidence (e.g., a document title, date, a link) and note the name of the group
or department that is adding an entry to the evidence addressing the
requirement along with the date of the annotations (e.g., [Right Management
group, 2/13/2013]). (Note that for requirements where Archivematica provides
all or part of the evidence, no date or group is specified as this evidence
must be reviewed and assigned a responsible group per repository) For
additional guidance, please see the Responsibilities for TRAC page of the
site.

Status
^^^^^^

The site provides a sequence of status levels for each requirement:

* Accepted – the evidence provided has been accepted as sufficient for this
  review round

* Ready for review – the Responsible group has completed its work and the
  evidence is ready for review

* In progress – the Responsible group is in the process of compiling or
  generating relevant evidence

* Not started – no evidence or information has been provided yet

For requirements where Archivematica provides all or part of the evidence, the
status is indicated as In Progress as it should still be reviewed, edited,
and/or completed by the repository.
