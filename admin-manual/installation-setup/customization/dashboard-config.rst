.. _dashboard-config:

============================
Dashboard Administration tab
============================

The Archivematica administration pages, under the Administration tab of the
dashboard, allow you to configure application components and manage users.

*On this page:*

* :ref:`Processing configuration <process-config>`
* :ref:`General <admin-dashboard-general>`
* :ref:`Failures <admin-dashboard-failures>`
* :ref:`Transfer source locations <admin-dashboard-transfer-source>`
* :ref:`AIP storage locations <admin-dashboard-AIP-stor>`

* :ref:`Language <admin-language-choice>`
* :ref:`Version <admin-version>`

.. _process-config:

Processing configuration
------------------------

The processing configuration administration page of the dashboard allows users
to configure the job decision points presented by Archivematica during transfer
and ingest. When you install Archivematica, there are two default processing
configurations:

* ``Default``, which is used for any transfer started manually from the
  :ref:`Transfer tab <create-transfer>`, automatically via the `automation tools`_,
  or in any other context where no other processing configuration is specified.
* ``Automated``, which is used for transfers automatically started from Jisc
  RDSS environments (if you are not a Jisc user, feel free to delete this
  configuration).

.. image:: images/processing-config.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Image showing the processing configuration page in the dashboard

By clicking **Edit**, you will be taken to a form where you can configure the
default processingMCP.xml that governs these decisions. Clicking on **Add** will
allow you to create a new processing configuration. When you change the options
using the web interface the necessary XML will be written behind the scenes.

.. image:: images/processing-config-choices.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Image showing the processing configuration edit page in the dashboard

For more information about configuring processing decisions in the Archivematica
dashboard, see :ref:`Processing configuration <dashboard-processing>` page in
the User Manual. The Processing configuration page contains a list of all of the
decision points and their options.

You can also revert the default and automated processing configurations to their
pre-sets by clicking on **Reset**. Please note that the pre-sets for the
default processing configuration are noted on the :ref:`Processing
configuration <dashboard-processing>` in the User Manual.

Changes to this form are written to a file called ``processingMCP.xml``. When
you start a transfer in the Archivematica dashboard, it automatically uses the
default processingMCP.xml.

.. _processingmcp-file:

Using a custom processing configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For more advanced workflows, you may wants to create multiple processing
configurations - for example, along with the default config, users might want to
have a configuration specific to video files. You can add a new processing
configuration through the user interface by clicking on the **Add** button.

Once you have created a custom processing configuration, you can download the
XML file by clicking on **Download**. Rename this file ``processingMCP.xml``.
Then place this file in the root directory of the transfer. Archivematica will
now use the included file to make processing decisions, rather than the default
configuration.

The processingMCP.xml follows a specific XML format:

.. code:: xml

.. _admin-dashboard-general:

General
-------

The General configuration page allows you to connect your Archivematica instance
to the Storage Service and set the default checksum algorithm used in
processing.

.. figure:: images/generalConfig.*
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 70%
   :width: 100%
   :alt: General configuration options in Administration tab of the dashboard

   General configuration options in Administration tab of the dashboard

General configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fields:

* **Site URL**: This is the public URL of your Archivematica dashboard. This
  field is optional.

.. note::
   Archivematica will try to register itself with the Storage Service. If you
   have installed Archivematica with a static URL or IP address, you may not
   need to set the Site URL here. However, if you expect the URL or IP address
   to change you should use a URL that will not change over time.

Storage Service options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Archivematica's storage spaces and locations are controlled by a back-end
application called the Storage Service. For more information about the Storage
Service, see the :ref:`Storage Service documentation <storageservice:index>`.

Fields:

* **Storage Service URL**: Full URL of the storage service. E.g.
  https://192.168.168.192:8000
* **Storage Service User**: User in the Storage Service to authenticate as.
  Obtain Storage Service credentials from the Administration tab of the Storage
  Service.
* **API key**: API key of the storage service user. Obtain Storage Service
  credentials from the Administration tab of the Storage Service.
* **Use default configuration**: Check this box if you have deployed the Storage
  Service using the default space and location configurations. If you have set
  up custom configurations, uncheck it.

Checksum algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can select which checksum algorithm Archivematica will use during the
*Assign UUIDs and checksums* microservice in Transfer. Choose between MD5,
SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512.

Elasticsearch indexing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of Archivematica 1.7, Elasticsearch is optional. Installing Archivematica
without Elasticsearch means reduced consumption of compute resources and lower
operational complexity. Disabling Elasticsearch means that the Backlog,
Appraisal, and Archival Storage tabs do not appear and their functionality is
not available.

This section in the General configuration shows if Elasticsearch is enabled or
disabled.

.. _admin-dashboard-failures:

Failures
--------

This page displays packages that failed during processing.

.. figure:: images/failuresAdmin.*
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 70%

   Failures report in the dashboard


Clicking the date, name or UUID will display a report of the failure:

.. image:: images/failReport.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: Failure report for a failed transfer

The failure report can be removed from the Dashboard by clicking Delete.

.. _admin-dashboard-transfer-source:

Transfer source location
------------------------

Archivematica allows you to start transfers using the operating system's file
browser or via a web interface. Source files for transfers, however, cannot be
uploaded using the web interface; they must exist on volumes accessible to the
Archivematica MCP server and configured via the Storage Service.

When starting a transfer you are required to select one or more directories of
files to add to the transfer.

.. _admin-dashboard-AIP-stor:

AIP storage locations
---------------------

AIP storage directories are directories in which completed AIPs are stored.
Storage directories can be specified in a manner similar to transfer source
directories using the Storage Service.

You can view your transfer source directories in the Administrative tab of the
dashboard under "AIP storage locations".

.. _admin-dashboard-usage:

Processing storage usage
------------------------

This section of the Administration page displays various processing locations
with their current usage of available space.

.. image:: images/ProcessingUsage.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Processing storage usage area of Administration page

Administrators can use the "clear" buttons to delete the contents of these
processing locations to make more room on their server.

.. _admin-dashboard-dip-upload:

DIP upload
----------

Archivematica has access integrations with three access platforms: AtoM, Binder
and ArchivesSpace.

.. _admin-dashboard-atom:

AtoM/Binder DIP upload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Archivematica can upload DIPs directly to an `AtoM`_ website so that the
contents can be accessed online. Using the same configuration screen, you can
also configure Archivematica to upload DIPs to `Binder`_, which is built off the
AtoM framework.

The AtoM/Binder DIP upload configuration page is where you specify the details
of the AtoM or Binder installation you'd like the DIPs uploaded to (and, if
using Rsync to transfer the DIP files, Rsync transfer details).

Before setting these details, please ensure that you have a working AtoM or
Binder site that is properly connected to Archivematica. See :ref:`Using AtoM
2.x with Archivematica <atom-setup>` or :ref:`Using Binder with Archivematica
<binder-setup>` for more information.

.. image:: images/AtoMDIPConfig.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Configuration screen for AtoM or Binder DIP uploads

Fields:

* **Upload URL**: the URL of the destination AtoM or Binder website.
* **Login email**: the email address used to log in to AtoM or Binder.
* **Login password**: the password used to log in to AtoM or Binder.
* **AtoM/Binder version**: the version of the destination AtoM or Binder website.
* **Rsync target**: if you'd like to send the DIP with Rsync before it is
  deposited in AtoM or Binder, enter the destination value for rsync, e.g.
  ``foobar.com:/dips``. This field is optional.
* **Rsync command**: if you've entered an Rsync target, specify the remote
  shell manually, e.g. ``ssh -p 22222 -l user``. This field is optional.
* **Debug mode**: if you would like to have additional details in failure
  reports, also enable debug mode by choosing "Yes".

AtoM DIP upload
+++++++++++++++

If AtoM is installed on a remote server, Archivematica uses SSH and rsync to
copy the DIP to a temporary directory on the AtoM server. If Archivematica and
AtoM share a common filesystem (e.g. a shared network directory) this step is
unnecessary.

Archivematica sends a REST request to AtoM to tell AtoM which archival
description is the target of the DIP. The DIP target description is identified
by the description's "slug".  The actual upload of the DIP contents to AtoM is
done via a background job, and may take some time to process if a large DIP is
uploaded.

An AtoM background worker uploads the DIP metadata (METS file) and digital
objects from the temporary directory to AtoM, links them to the target
description, then deletes the temporary files.

You will also need to make some changes in the AtoM user interface:

* The SWORD plugin (Admin --> Plugins --> qtSwordPlugin) must be enabled in
  order for AtoM to receive uploaded DIPs.

* Enabling Job scheduling (Admin --> Settings --> Job scheduling) in version 2.1
  or lower is also recommended.

AtoM DIP upload can use Rsync as a transfer mechanism. Rsync is an open source
utility for efficiently transferring files. The rsync-target parameter is used
to specify an Rsync-style target host/directory pairing, ``foobar.com:~/dips/``
for example. The rsync-command parameter is used to specify rsync connection
options, ``ssh -p 22222 -l user`` for example. If you are using the rsync
option, please see AtoM server configuration below.

To set any parameters for AtoM DIP upload change the values, preserving the
existing format they're specified in, in the ``Command arguments`` field then
click "Save".

.. NOTE::

   If you are planning to use the :ref:`metadata-only DIP upload to AtoM
   <upload-metadata-atom>` functionality don't forget to enable the :ref:`API
   plugin in AtoM <atom:api-intro>`, generate a API key, and update the ``REST
   API key`` field accordingly. Metadata-only DIP upload is only available if
   you are using AtoM 2.4 or higher.

AtoM server configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

This server configuration step is necessary to allow Archivematica to log in
to the AtoM server without passwords, and only when the user is deploying the
rsync option described above in the AtoM DIP upload section.

To enable sending DIPs from Archivematica to the AtoM server:

Generate SSH keys for the Archivematica user. Leave the passphrase field
blank.

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo -u archivematica ssh-keygen


Copy the contents of ``/var/lib/archivematica/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`` somewhere
handy, you will need it later.

Now, it's time to configure the AtoM server so Archivematica can send the DIPs
using SSH/rsync. For that purpose, you will create a user called ``archivematica``
and we are going to assign that user a restricted shell with access only to
rsync:

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo apt-get install rssh
   $ sudo useradd -d /home/archivematica -m -s /usr/bin/rssh archivematica
   $ sudo passwd -l archivematica
   $ sudo vim /etc/rssh.conf // Make sure that allowrsync is uncommented!

Add the SSH key that we generated before:

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo mkdir /home/archivematica/.ssh
   $ chmod 700 /home/archivematica/.ssh/
   $ sudo vim /home/archivematica/.ssh/authorized_keys // Paste here the contents of id_dsa.pub
   $ chown -R archivematica:archivematica /home/archivematica

In Archivematica, make sure that you update the ``--rsync-target`` accordingly.
These are the parameters that we are passing to the upload-qubit microservice.
Go to the Administration > Upload DIP page in the dashboard.

Generic parameters:

.. code:: bash

   --url="http://atom-hostname/index.php" \
   --email="demo@example.com" \
   --password="demo" \
   --uuid="%SIPUUID%" \
   --rsync-target="archivematica@atom-hostname:/tmp" \
   --debug

Binder DIP upload
+++++++++++++++++

For more information about configuring Binder, please see the :ref:`Binder
integrations page <binder-setup>`.

.. _admin-dashboard-AS:

ArchivesSpace DIP upload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before ingesting digital objects destined for ArchivesSpace, ensure that the
ArchivesSpace DIP upload settings in the Administration tab of the dashboard
have been set.

These settings should be created and saved before digital objects destined for
upload to ArchivesSpace are processed. Note that these can be set once and used
for processing any number of transfers (i.e. they do not need to be re-set for
each transfer).

.. image:: images/ASDIPConfig.*
   :align: right
   :width: 45%
   :alt: ArchivesSpace configuration settings

Fields:

* **ArchivesSpace host**: the URL of the host database. Do not include
  ``https://`` or ``www.``, e.g. ``aspace.test.org``.
* **ArchivesSpace backend port**: the port of the database, e.g. ``8089``.
* **ArchivesSpace administrative user**: the username of a user with
  administrative permissions in ArchivesSpace.
* **ArchivesSpace administrative user password**: the password for user set
  above. If you make changes to this configuration, you will need to re-enter
  the password.
* **Restrictions Apply**: Selecting *Yes* will apply a blanket access
  restriction to all content uploaded from Archivematica to ArchivesSpace.
  Selecting *No* will send all content to ArchivesSpace without restrictions.
  Should you wish to enable the PREMIS-based restrictions functionality, choose
  *Base on PREMIS*.
* **XLink Show**: indicate how the link to the digital object, as it appears in
  ArchivesSpace, should operate.

  * *Embed*: the digital object screen is embedded in the current window.
  * *New*: the digital object screen opens in a new window.
  * *None*: no specific behaviour is passed to the link.
  * *Other*: no specific behaviour is passed to the link.
  * *Replace*: the digital object screen opens in the current window.

* **XLink Actuate**: indicates when a digital object should display in
  ArchivesSpace (e.g. whether the link occurs automatically or must be requested
  by the user). Used in conjunction with XLink Show attribute.

  * *None*: no specific behaviour is passed to the link.
  * *onLoad*: link is activated when the document loads (used when Show =
    Embed).
  * *Other*: no specific behaviour is passed to the link.
  * *onRequest*: link is activated when the user selects the link.

* **Object Type**: entering a value from ArchivesSpace's controlled list of
  object types will apply this value to all objects. This field is optional.
* **Use statement**: entering a value from ArchivesSpace's controlled list of
  use statements will apply this value to all objects. This field is optional.
* **URL prefix**: the URL of DIP object server as you wish it to appear in
  ArchivesSpace record. Example: ``http://example.com``
* **Conditions governing access**: entering a value in this field will populate
  the Conditions governing access note in ArchivesSpace for all objects.
* **Conditions governing use**: entering a value in this field will populate
  the Conditions governing use note in ArchivesSpace for all objects.
* **ArchivesSpace repository number**: the identifier for the ArchivesSpace
  repository where you are uploading DIPs. Note that the default identifier for
  a single-repository ArchivesSpace instance is *2*.

.. NOTE::
   In order to save changes to the ArchivesSpace DIP upload configuration, you
   must enter the password before clicking save. Note that Archivematica will
   *not* display an error if the password is not entered.

.. _admin-dashboard-premis:

PREMIS agent
------------

The PREMIS agent name and code can be set here via the administration interface.

.. image:: images/PREMISAdmin.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: PREMIS agent settings in Administration tab

The PREMIS agent information is used in the METS files created by Archivematica
to identify the agency performing the digital preservation events.

.. _admin-dashboard-rest:

Rest API
--------

In addition to automation using the ``processingMCP.xml`` file, Archivematica
includes a REST API for automating transfer approval. Using this API, you can
create a custom script that copies a transfer to the appropriate directory
then uses the curl command, or some other means, to let Archivematica know
that the copy is complete.

API keys
^^^^^^^^

Use of the REST API requires the use of API keys. An API key is associated
with a specific user. To generate an API key for a user:

* Browse to /administration/accounts/list/

* Click the "Edit" button for the user you'd like to generate an API key for

* Click the "Regenerate API key" checkbox

* Click "Save"

After generating an API key, you can click the "Edit" button for the user and
you should see the API key.

IP whitelist
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The API key is always required but in some cases the administrator may want to
add an additional security measurement. IP whitelisting allows you to create a
list of trusted IP addresses from which you can access to the API.

The IP whitelist can be edited in the administration interface at
``/administration/api/``. If the whitelist is empty all requests will be
allowed.

Approving a transfer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The REST API can be used to approve a transfer. The transfer must first be
copied into the appropriate watch directory. To determine the location of the
appropriate watch directory, first figure out where the shared directory is
from the watchDirectoryPath value of
``/etc/archivematica/MCPServer/serverConfig.conf``. Within that directory is a
subdirectory activeTransfers. In this subdirectory are watch directories for
the various transfer types.

When using the REST API to approve a transfer, if a transfer type isn't
specified, the transfer will be deemed a standard transfer.

**HTTP Method**: POST

**URL**: /api/transfer/approve

**Parameters**:

``directory``: directory name of the transfer

``type`` (optional): transfer type [standard|dspace|unzipped bag|zipped bag]

``api_key``: an API key

``username``: the username associated with the API key

Example curl command:

.. code:: bash

   curl --data "username=rick&api_key=f12d6b323872b3cef0b71be64eddd52f87b851a6&type=standard&directory=MyTransfer" http://127.0.0.1/api/transfer/approve

Example result:

.. code:: bash

   {"message": "Approval successful."}

Listing unapproved transfers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The REST API can be used to get a list of unapproved transfers. Each
transfer's directory name and type is returned.

**Method**: ``GET``

**URL**: ``/api/transfer/unapproved``

**Parameters**:

``api_key``: an API key

``username``: the username associated with the API key

Example curl command:

.. code:: bash

   curl "http://127.0.0.1/api/transfer/unapproved?username=rick&api_key=f12d6b323872b3cef0b71be64eddd52f87b851a6"

Example result:

.. code:: bash

   {
       "message": "Fetched unapproved transfers successfully.",
       "results": [{
               "directory": "MyTransfer",
              "type": "standard"
           }
       ]
   }

.. _admin-dashboard-users:

Users
-----

The dashboard provides a simple cookie-based user authentication system using
the `Django authentication framework`_. Access to the dashboard is limited only
to logged-in users and a login page will be shown when the user is not
recognized. If the application can't find any user in the database, the user
creation page will be shown instead, allowing the creation of an administrator
account.

Users can be also created, modified and deleted from the Administration tab.
Only users who are administrators can create and edit user accounts.

You can add a new user to the system by clicking the "Add new" button on the
user administration page. By adding a user you provide a way to access
Archivematica using a username/password combination. Should you need to change
a user's username or password, you can do so by clicking the "Edit" button,
corresponding to the user, on the administration page. Should you need to
revoke a user's access, you can click the corresponding "Delete" button.

CLI creation of administrative users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need an additional administrator user one can be created via the
command-line, issue the following commands:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u archivematica bash -c " \
       set -a -e -x
       source /etc/default/archivematica-dashboard || \
           source /etc/sysconfig/archivematica-dashboard \
               || (echo 'Environment file not found'; exit 1)
       cd /usr/share/archivematica/dashboard
       /usr/share/archivematica/virtualenvs/archivematica-dashboard/bin/python manage.py createsuperuser
   ";

CLI password resetting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you've forgotten the password for your administrator user, or any other
user, you can change it via the command-line:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u archivematica bash -c " \
       set -a -e -x
       source /etc/default/archivematica-dashboard || \
           source /etc/sysconfig/archivematica-dashboard \
               || (echo 'Environment file not found'; exit 1)
       cd /usr/share/archivematica/dashboard
       /usr/share/archivematica/virtualenvs/archivematica-dashboard/bin/python manage.py changepassword <username>
   ";

CLI configuration pipeline and registration on the Storage Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On new installations, the superuser can be configured and the pipeline
registered on the Storage Service using the command-line instead of the GUI.
These commands configure the pipeline and register it on the Storage Service
exactly like the GUI for the initial configuration screen:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u archivematica bash -c " \
       set -a -e -x
       source /etc/default/archivematica-dashboard || \
           source /etc/sysconfig/archivematica-dashboard \
               || (echo 'Environment file not found'; exit 1)
       cd /usr/share/archivematica/dashboard
       /usr/share/python/archivematica-dashboard/bin/python manage.py install \
           --username=<username> \
           --password=<password> \
           --email=<email-address> \
           --org-name=<org-name> \
           --org-id=<org-id> \
           --api-key=<api-key>\
           --ss-url=<ss-ulr> \
           --ss-user=<ss-username> \
           --ss-api-key=<ss-api-key> \
           --whitelist=<whitelist>
   ";

Where:

* ``api-key``: API key that will be added to the username <username>. For
  example: "test", "4e5f32ab2aefd3577e1b19a2de5d4dd65f90101a".

* ``ss-url``: Archivematica Storage Service URL. For example:
  http://example.archivematica.org:8000.

* ``ss-user``: The Storage Service username that will be used to register the
  pipeline. This username must already exist in the Storage Service.

* ``ss-api-key``: The <ss-username> API key. This key must already exist in the
  Storage Service for the user <ss-username>.

* ``whitelist``: Whitespace-separated list of IP addresses or hostnames allowed
  to use the API. If the whitelist is left empty, all IP addresses and
  hostnames will be allowed. For example: "192.168.1.3
  example.archivematica.org 127.0.0.1" or "".

This command is most suitable to use on automated installations, for example
when deploying using ansible. For manual installations, please use the web
configuration method described in the Post Install Configuration sections:

* :ref:`Ubuntu Post Install Configuration <ubuntu-post-install-config>`.
* :ref:`CentOS Post Install Configuration <centos-post-install-config>`.
* :ref:`Ansible Post Install Configuration <ansible-post-install-config>`.

Security
^^^^^^^^

Archivematica uses `PBKDF2`_ as the default algorithm to store passwords. This
should be sufficient for most users: it's quite secure, requiring massive
amounts of computing time to break. However, other algorithms could be used as
the following document explains: `How Django stores passwords`_ .

Our plan is to extend this functionality in the future adding groups and
granular permissions support.

.. _admin-handlenet:

Handle server config
--------------------

Archivematica can mint persistent identifiers (PIDs) for digital objects,
directories, or AIPs by defining the PIDs in a configured `Handle.Net`_
registry. Handle.Net can then create persistent URLs (PURLs) from the PIDs and
can reroute requests to the persistent URLs to a target URL that is configured
in Handle.Net.

.. note::

   In order to use the Handle.Net configuration, you will need to provide an
   available web service. See the `PID webservice being used by IISH`_ for an
   example of a compatible web service.

Fields:

* **Web service endpoint**: The URL for (POST) requests to create and resolve
  PIDs.
* **Web service key**: Web service key needed for authentication to make
  PID-binding requests to the PID web service endpoint.
* **Naming authority**: Handle naming authority (e.g., 12345)
* **Resolver URL**: The URL to append generated PIDs to in order to create
  (potentially qualified) PURLs (persistent URLs) that resolve to the applicable
  resolve URL. Note the second "r" in "resolver"!
* **AIP PID source**: The source of the AIP's persistent identifier. The UUID of
  the AIP is the default since it is virtually guaranteed to be unique. However,
  the accession number of the transfer may be used, assuming the user can
  guarantee a 1-to-1 relationship between the transfer and the AIP.
* **Verify SSL certificates**: Selecting this box will ensure that Archivematica
  verifies SSL certificates when making requests to bind PIDs.
* **Archive resolve URL template**: Template (Django or Jinja2) for the URL that
  a unit's PURL should resolve to. Has access to ``pid`` and
  ``naming_authority`` variables. Example:
  ``https://access.myinstitution.org/dip/{{ naming_authority }}/{{ pid }}``
* **METS resolve URL template**: Template (Django or Jinja2) for the URL that a
  unit's PURL with the "mets" qualifier should resolve to. Has access to "pid"
  and "naming_authority" variables. Example:
  ``https://access.myinstitution.org/mets/{{ naming_authority }}/{{ pid }}``
* **File resolve URL template**: Template (Django or Jinja2) for the URL
  that a file's PURL should resolve to. Has access to "pid" and
  "naming_authority" variables. Example:
  ``https://access.myinstitution.org/access/{{ naming_authority }}/{{ pid }}``
* **Access derivative resolve URL template**: Template (Django or Jinja2) for
  the URL that a file's PURL with the "access" qualifier should resolve to. Has
  access to "pid" and "naming_authority" variables. Example:
  ``https://access.myinstitution.org/access/{{ naming_authority }}/{{ pid }}``
* **Preservation derivative resolve URL template**: Template (Django or Jinja2)
  for the URL that a file's PURL with the "preservation" qualifier should
  resolve to. Has access to "pid" and "naming_authority" variables. Example:
  ``https://access.myinstitution.org/preservation/{{ naming_authority }}/{{ pid }}``
* **Original file resolve URL template**: Template (Django or Jinja2) for the
  URL that a file's PURL with the "original" qualifier should resolve to. Has
  access to "pid" and "naming_authority" variables. Example:
  ``https://access.myinstitution.org/original/{{ naming_authority }}/{{ pid }}``
* **PID/handle request request body template**: Template (Django or Jinja2) that
  constructs the HTTP request body using the rendered URL templates above. Has
  access to the following variables: "pid", "naming_authority",
  "base_resolve_url", and "qualified_resolve_urls", the last of which is a list
  of dicts with "url" and "qualifier" keys. Example::

    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
    <soapenv:Envelope
      xmlns:soapenv='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/'
      xmlns:pid='http://pid.myinstitution.org/'>
      <soapenv:Body>
        <pid:UpsertPidRequest>
          <pid:na>{{ naming_authority }}</pid:na>
          <pid:handle>
            <pid:pid>{{ naming_authority }}/{{ pid }}</pid:pid>
            <pid:locAtt>
              <pid:location weight='1' href='{{ base_resolve_url }}'/>
              {% for qrurl in qualified_resolve_urls %}
                <pid:location
                  weight='0'
                  href='{{ qrurl.url }}'
                  view='{{ qrurl.qualifier }}'/>
              {% endfor %}
            </pid:locAtt>
          </pid:handle>
        </pid:UpsertPidRequest>
      </soapenv:Body>
    </soapenv:Envelope>
