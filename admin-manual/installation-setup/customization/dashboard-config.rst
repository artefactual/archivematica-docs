.. _process-config:

Processing configuration
------------------------

The processing configuration administration page of the dashboard allows users
to configure the job decision points presented by Archivematica during transfer
and ingest. This screen provides you with an easy form to configure the default
processingMCP.xml that governs these decisions. When you change the options
using the web interface the necessary XML will be written behind the scenes.

.. image:: images/processing-config.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Image showing the Processing configuration page in the dashboard

For more information about configuring processing decisions in the Archivematica
dashboard, see the :ref:`Processing configuration <dashboard-processing>` in the
User Manual. This page contains a list of all of the decision points and their
options.

.. _processingmcp-file:

Creating a custom config with processingMCP.xml
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When processing a SIP or transfer, you may want to automate some of the workflow
choices. The processing configuration administration page of the dashboard
provides you with an easy form to configure various decision points in the
Archivematica workflow. Changes to this form are written to a file called
``processingMCP.xml``. When you start a transfer in the Archivematica dashboard,
it automatically uses the default processingMCP.xml.

For more advanced workflows, it might be desirable to create multiple processing
configurations - for example, along with the default config, users might want
to have a configuration specific to video files. You can add a new processing
config through the user interface by clicking on the **Add** button.

.. image:: images/add-processing-config.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Image showing the Processing configuration page in the dashboard

Once you have created a custom processing configuration, you can download the
XML file from ``/var/archivematica/sharedDirectory/share
dMicroServiceTasksConfigs/processingMCPConfigs/``. Then place this file in the
root directory of the transfer. Archivematica will now use the included file
to make processing decisions.

The processingMCP.xml follows a specific XML format:

.. code:: bash

.. _admin-dashboard-general:

General
-------

In this section, you can configure the following for your Archivematica client:

* Storage Service options
* Checksum algorithm
* Elasticsearch indexing

.. figure:: images/generalConfig.*
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 70%
   :width: 100%
   :alt: General configuration options in Administration tab of the dashboard

   General configuration options in Administration tab of the dashboard

Storage Service options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is where you'll find the complete URL for the Storage Service, along with a
username and API key. See the Storage Service documentation for more information
about this feature.

Checksum algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can select which checksum algorithm Archivematica will use during the
*Assign UUIDs and checksums* micro-service in Transfer. Choose between MD5,
SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512.

Elasticsearch indexing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of Archivematica 1.7, Elasticsearch is optional. Installing Archivematica
without Elasticsearch means reduced consumption of compute resources and lower
operational complexity. Disabling Elasticsearch means that the Backlog,
Appraisal, and Archival Storage tabs do not appear and their functionality is
not available.

This section in the General configuration shows if Elasticsearch is enabled or
disabled.

.. _admin-dashboard-failures:

Failures
--------

This page displays packages that failed during processing.

.. figure:: images/failuresAdmin.*

Clicking the date, name or UUID will display a report of the failure:

.. image:: images/failReport.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: Failure report for a failed transfer

The failure report can be removed from the Dashboard by clicking Delete.

.. _admin-dashboard-transfer-source:

Transfer source location
------------------------

Archivematica allows you to start transfers using the operating system's file
browser or via a web interface. Source files for transfers, however, cannot be
uploaded using the web interface; they must exist on volumes accessible to the
Archivematica MCP server and configured via the Storage Service.

When starting a transfer you are required to select one or more directories of
files to add to the transfer.

.. _admin-dashboard-AIP-stor:

AIP storage locations
---------------------

AIP storage directories are directories in which completed AIPs are stored.
Storage directories can be specified in a manner similar to transfer source
directories using the Storage Service.

You can view your transfer source directories in the Administrative tab of the
dashboard under "AIP storage locations".

.. _admin-dashboard-usage:

Processing storage usage
------------------------

This section of the Administration page displays various processing locations
with their current usage of available space.

.. image:: images/ProcessingUsage.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Processing storage usage area of Administration page

Administrators can use the "clear" buttons to delete the contents of these
processing locations to make more room on their server.

.. _admin-dashboard-dip-upload:

DIP upload
----------

Archivematica has access integrations with three access platforms: AtoM,
ArchivesSpace, and Archivists' Toolkit.

.. _admin-dashboard-atom:

AtoM DIP upload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Archivematica can upload DIPs directly to an `AtoM`_ website so that the
contents can be accessed online. The AtoM DIP upload configuration page is where
you specify the AtoM installation where you'd like to upload DIPs (and, if you
are using Rsync to transfer the DIP files, the Rsync transfer details).

If AtoM is installed on a remote server, Archivematica uses SSH and rsync to
copy the DIP to a temporary directory on the AtoM server. If Archivematica and
AtoM share a common filesystem (e.g. a shared network directory) this step is
unnecessary.

Archivematica sends a REST request to AtoM to tell AtoM which archival
description is the target of the DIP. The DIP target description is identified
by the description's "slug".  The actual upload of the DIP contents to AtoM is
done via a background job, and may take some time to process if a large DIP is
uploaded.

An AtoM background worker uploads the DIP metadata (METS file) and digital
objects from the temporary directory to AtoM, links them to the target
description, then deletes the temporary files.

The AtoM DIP upload configuration page is where you specify the details of the
AtoM installation you'd like the DIPs uploaded to (and, if using Rsync to
transfer the DIP files, Rsync transfer details).

.. image:: images/AtoMDIPConfig.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Configuration screen for AtoM DIP uploads

Fields:

* **Upload URL**: the URL of the destination AtoM website.
* **Login email**: the email address used to log in to AtoM.
* **Login password**: the password used to log in to AtoM.
* **AtoM version**: the version of the destination AtoM website.
* **Rsync target**: if you'd like to send the DIP with Rsync before it is
  deposited in AtoM, enter the destination value for rsync, e.g.
  ``foobar.com:/dips``. This field is optional.
* **Rsync command**: if you've entered an Rsync target, specify the remote
  shell manually, e.g. ``ssh -p 22222 -l user``. This field is optional.
* **Debug mode**: if you would like to have additional details in failure
  reports, also enable debug mode by choosing "Yes".

You will also need to make some changes in the AtoM user interface:

* The SWORD plugin (Admin --> Plugins --> qtSwordPlugin) must be enabled in
  order for AtoM to receive uploaded DIPs.

* Enabling Job scheduling (Admin --> Settings --> Job scheduling) in version 2.1
  or lower is also recommended.

AtoM DIP upload can use Rsync as a transfer mechanism. Rsync is an open source
utility for efficiently transferring files. The rsync-target parameter is used
to specify an Rsync-style target host/directory pairing, ``foobar.com:~/dips/``
for example. The rsync-command parameter is used to specify rsync connection
options, ``ssh -p 22222 -l user`` for example. If you are using the rsync
option, please see AtoM server configuration below.

To set any parameters for AtoM DIP upload change the values, preserving the
existing format they're specified in, in the ``Command arguments`` field then
click "Save".

.. NOTE::

   If you are planning to use the *metadata-only DIP upload to AtoM*
   functionality don't forget to enable the :ref:`the API plugin in AtoM
   <atom:api-intro>`, generate a API key and update the ``REST API key`` field
   accordingly. Metadata-only upload is only available since AtoM 2.4.

AtoM server configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

This server configuration step is necessary to allow Archivematica to log in
to the AtoM server without passwords, and only when the user is deploying the
rsync option described above in the AtoM DIP upload section.

To enable sending DIPs from Archivematica to the AtoM server:

Generate SSH keys for the Archivematica user. Leave the passphrase field
blank.

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo -u archivematica ssh-keygen


Copy the contents of ``/var/lib/archivematica/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`` somewhere
handy, you will need it later.

Now, it's time to configure the AtoM server so Archivematica can send the DIPs
using SSH/rsync. For that purpose, you will create a user called ``archivematica``
and we are going to assign that user a restricted shell with access only to
rsync:

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo apt-get install rssh
   $ sudo useradd -d /home/archivematica -m -s /usr/bin/rssh archivematica
   $ sudo passwd -l archivematica
   $ sudo vim /etc/rssh.conf // Make sure that allowrsync is uncommented!

Add the SSH key that we generated before:

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo mkdir /home/archivematica/.ssh
   $ chmod 700 /home/archivematica/.ssh/
   $ sudo vim /home/archivematica/.ssh/authorized_keys // Paste here the contents of id_dsa.pub
   $ chown -R archivematica:archivematica /home/archivematica

In Archivematica, make sure that you update the ``--rsync-target`` accordingly.
These are the parameters that we are passing to the upload-qubit microservice.
Go to the Administration > Upload DIP page in the dashboard.

Generic parameters:

.. code:: bash

   --url="http://atom-hostname/index.php" \
   --email="demo@example.com" \
   --password="demo" \
   --uuid="%SIPUUID%" \
   --rsync-target="archivematica@atom-hostname:/tmp" \
   --debug

.. _admin-dashboard-AS:

ArchivesSpace DIP upload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before ingesting digital objects destined for ArchivesSpace, ensure that the
ArchivesSpace DIP upload settings in the Administration tab of the dashboard
have been set.

These settings should be created and saved before digital objects destined for
upload to ArchivesSpace are processed. Note that these can be set once and used
for processing any number of transfers (i.e. they do not need to be re-set for
each transfer).

.. image:: images/ASDIPConfig.*

   must enter the password before clicking save. Note that Archivematica will
   *not* display an error if the password is not entered.

.. _admin-dashboard-AT:

Archivists' Toolkit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before ingesting digital objects destined for Archivists' Toolkit, ensure that
the Achivists' Toolkit DIP upload settings in the Administration tab of the
dashboard have been set.

These settings should be created and saved before digital objects destined for
upload to Archivists Toolkit are processed. Note that these can be set once and
used for processing any number of transfers (i.e. they do not need to be re-set
for each transfer). The screenshots below show the template in the dashboard.

.. important::

   Archivists' Toolkit is a legacy application that is no longer being
   maintained as of September 2013. DIP upload to Archivists' Toolkit is

.. _admin-dashboard-premis:

PREMIS agent
------------

The PREMIS agent name and code can be set here via the administration interface.

.. image:: images/PREMISAdmin.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: PREMIS agent settings in Administration tab

The PREMIS agent information is used in the METS files created by Archivematica
to identify the agency performing the digital preservation events.

.. _admin-dashboard-rest:

Rest API
--------

In addition to automation using the ``processingMCP.xml`` file, Archivematica
includes a REST API for automating transfer approval. Using this API, you can
create a custom script that copies a transfer to the appropriate directory
then uses the curl command, or some other means, to let Archivematica know
that the copy is complete.

API keys
^^^^^^^^

Use of the REST API requires the use of API keys. An API key is associated
with a specific user. To generate an API key for a user:

* Browse to /administration/accounts/list/

* Click the "Edit" button for the user you'd like to generate an API key for

* Click the "Regenerate API key" checkbox

* Click "Save"

After generating an API key, you can click the "Edit" button for the user and
you should see the API key.

IP whitelist
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The API key is always required but in some cases the administrator may want to
add an additional security measurement. IP whitelisting allows you to create a
list of trusted IP addresses from which you can access to the API.

The IP whitelist can be edited in the administration interface at
``/administration/api/``. If the whitelist is empty all requests will be
allowed.

Approving a transfer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The REST API can be used to approve a transfer. The transfer must first be
copied into the appropriate watch directory. To determine the location of the
appropriate watch directory, first figure out where the shared directory is
from the watchDirectoryPath value of
``/etc/archivematica/MCPServer/serverConfig.conf``. Within that directory is a
subdirectory activeTransfers. In this subdirectory are watch directories for
the various transfer types.

When using the REST API to approve a transfer, if a transfer type isn't
specified, the transfer will be deemed a standard transfer.

**HTTP Method**: POST

**URL**: /api/transfer/approve

**Parameters**:

``directory``: directory name of the transfer

``type`` (optional): transfer type [standard|dspace|unzipped bag|zipped bag]

``api_key``: an API key

``username``: the username associated with the API key

Example curl command:

.. code:: bash

   curl --data "username=rick&api_key=f12d6b323872b3cef0b71be64eddd52f87b851a6&type=standard&directory=MyTransfer" http://127.0.0.1/api/transfer/approve

Example result:

.. code:: bash

   {"message": "Approval successful."}

Listing unapproved transfers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The REST API can be used to get a list of unapproved transfers. Each
transfer's directory name and type is returned.

**Method**: ``GET``

**URL**: ``/api/transfer/unapproved``

**Parameters**:

``api_key``: an API key

``username``: the username associated with the API key

Example curl command:

.. code:: bash

   curl "http://127.0.0.1/api/transfer/unapproved?username=rick&api_key=f12d6b323872b3cef0b71be64eddd52f87b851a6"

Example result:

.. code:: bash

   {
       "message": "Fetched unapproved transfers successfully.",
       "results": [{
               "directory": "MyTransfer",
              "type": "standard"
           }
       ]
   }

.. _admin-dashboard-users:

Users
-----

The dashboard provides a simple cookie-based user authentication system using
the `Django authentication framework`_. Access to the dashboard is limited only
to logged-in users and a login page will be shown when the user is not
recognized. If the application can't find any user in the database, the user
creation page will be shown instead, allowing the creation of an administrator
account.

Users can be also created, modified and deleted from the Administration tab.
Only users who are administrators can create and edit user accounts.

You can add a new user to the system by clicking the "Add new" button on the
user administration page. By adding a user you provide a way to access
Archivematica using a username/password combination. Should you need to change
a user's username or password, you can do so by clicking the "Edit" button,
corresponding to the user, on the administration page. Should you need to
revoke a user's access, you can click the corresponding "Delete" button.

CLI creation of administrative users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need an additional administrator user one can be created via the
command-line, issue the following commands:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u archivematica bash -c " \
       set -a -e -x
       source /etc/default/archivematica-dashboard || \
           source /etc/sysconfig/archivematica-dashboard \
               || (echo 'Environment file not found'; exit 1)
       cd /usr/share/archivematica/dashboard
       /usr/share/archivematica/virtualenvs/archivematica-dashboard/bin/python manage.py createsuperuser
   ";

CLI password resetting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you've forgotten the password for your administrator user, or any other
user, you can change it via the command-line:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u archivematica bash -c " \
       set -a -e -x
       source /etc/default/archivematica-dashboard || \
           source /etc/sysconfig/archivematica-dashboard \
               || (echo 'Environment file not found'; exit 1)
       cd /usr/share/archivematica/dashboard
       /usr/share/archivematica/virtualenvs/archivematica-dashboard/bin/python manage.py changepassword <username>
   ";

Security
^^^^^^^^

Archivematica uses `PBKDF2 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2>`_ as the default
algorithm to store passwords. This should be sufficient for most users: it's
quite secure, requiring massive amounts of computing time to break. However,
other algorithms could be used as the following document explains:
`How Django stores passwords <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/auth/#how-django-stores-passwords>`_ .

Our plan is to extend this functionality in the future adding groups and
granular permissions support.

.. _admin-handle-server:

Handle server config
--------------------
Archivematica can to be configured to make requests to a Handle System HTTP API
so that files, directories and entire AIPs can be assigned persistent
identifiers (PIDS) and derived persistent URLs (PURLs).

.. _admin-language-choice:

Language
