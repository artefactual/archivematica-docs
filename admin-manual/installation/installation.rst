.. _overview:

Overview
========

Archivematica is not a single application, there are a dozens of different 
components and tools required for a full working installation.  As a result 
there are many possible deployment configurations.  

These instructions are designed to get you up and running as quickly as 
possible, even if you are not familiar with the linux operating system or the 
various tools and applications that are bundled into an Archivematica 
installation.  

Experience with the linux command line is helpful, and to support a running 
production system, it should be considered a requirement.  

Don't be afraid to ask for help if you get stuck, or if you don't understand
some part of the instructions.  The Archivematica google group is a good place
to look for assistance.

.. _tech-requirements:

Technical Requirements
======================

**Operating System** 

Archivematica 1.6.0 has been tested with:

* Ubuntu 14.04.5 64 bit Server Edition
* CentOS 7.3.1611 64 bit

Support for Ubuntu 16.04 is being tested, and is planned for a future release.  
Other linux distributions should work, but will require customization of these
installation instructions.  

Support for Mac OS X is possibly in theory, but is not being tested, and would
require more significant deviation from these instructions.

Archivematica is unlikely to ever run in a Windows environment.  Consider the 
use of a virtualization platform to run linux vm's. 

**Hardware**

Archivematica is capable of running on almost any hardware supported by linux; 
however, processing large collections will require better hardware. See

* :ref:`Minimum Hardware Requirements <requirements-small>`
* :ref:`Recommended Minimum Production Requirements <requirements-production>`

**Dependencies**

Archivematica has a long list of software it depends on.  All of these 
dependencies are intalled when following the instructions below.

In these instructions everything is installed into one machine.  It is possible
to install some of the components on separate machines, to improve performance,
such as:

*MySQL
*ElasticSearch
*gearman

Using additional machines requires some additional configuration.

See :ref:`Advanced <advanced>`.

**Notes**: 

Archivematica 1.6.0 requires ElasticSearch 1.x (tested with 1.7.5).
Support for ElasticSearch 2.x and 5.x is being developed and is planned for a 
future release.

Archivematica 1.6.0 has been tested with MySQL 5.5, including the Percona and
MariaDB alternatives.  Archivematica should work with MySQL 5.6.

The remaining dependencies should be kept at the versions installed by 
Archivematica.

.. _requirements-small:

Minimum Hardware Requirements
-----------------------------

For small-scale functionality testing using small collections (transfers with 100 files or 
less, 1 GB or smaller)

* Processor: 2 CPU cores
* Memory: 2GB+
* Disk space: 7GB plus two to three times the disk space required for the 
  collection being processed (e.g., 3GB to process a 1GB transfer)

.. _requirements-production:

Recommended Minimum Production Requirements
-------------------------------------------

For production processing the hardware requirements depend almost entirely on
the size and number of files being processed.  These recommendations should be
considered the minimum for a viable production system:

* Processor: 2 CPU cores 
* Memory: 4GB+
* Disk space: 20GB plus three to four times the disk space required for the 
  collection being processed (e.g., 200GB to process a 50GB transfer)

These requirements may not be suitable for certain types of material, e.g. audio-visual.


-- _new-install:

New Installation
================

When intalling Archivematica for the first time, there are a few choices to 
make before starting.  

* choice of installation method (manual or ansible).
* choice of installation source (os packages or github).
* choice of operating system (ubuntu or centos/rhel).

Instructions are provided for the following choices:

* :ref:`Manual Install of OS Packages on Ubuntu <install-pkg-ubuntu>`
* :ref:`Manual Install of OS Packages on CentOS/Redhat <install-pkg-centos>`
* :ref:`Automated Install from Github on Ubuntu <ansible-git-ubuntu>`

Other combinations work, but are not covered in this documentation. Please
see the ansible-archivematica-src repo, the deploy-pub repo and ask on the
archivematica-tech mailing list for more details.


.. _install-pkg-ubuntu:

Installing Ubuntu Packages
--------------------------

Archivematica packages are hosted at packages.archivematica.org. This has been 
introduced to allow one central place to store packages for multiple OS's.

1. Add Package Sources

* Archivematica

Add packages.archivematica.org to your list of trusted repositories

.. code:: bash

   sudo wget -O - https://packages.archivematica.org/1.6.x/key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://packages.archivematica.org/1.6.x/ubuntu trusty main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
   sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://packages.archivematica.org/1.6.x/ubuntu-externals trusty main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'

* ElasticSearch

Elasticsearch comes from its own package repository

.. code:: bash

   sudo wget -O - http://packages.elasticsearch.org/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/1.7/debian stable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'

2. Update your system 

Update to the most recent 14.04 release. This step will also fetch a list of 
the software from the repositories you just added to your system.

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade

3. Install Elasticsearch

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get install elasticsearch

4. Install the storage service package

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get install -y archivematica-storage-service

5. Upgrade python setuptools

This is used to install python dependencies for both the storage service and 
the dashboard.  There is a _known issue: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-pip/+bug/1658844 with the version of pip installed on Ubuntu 14.04, which makes this step necessary.

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get install -y python-pip
   sudo pip install -U setuptools

6. Configure the storage service

.. code:: bash

   sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/storage /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/storage

7. Install the Archivematica packages 

Each of these packages can be installed separately, if necessary). 

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get install -y archivematica-mcp-server
   sudo apt-get install -y archivematica-dashboard
   sudo apt-get install -y archivematica-mcp-client

8. Configure the dashboard

.. code:: bash

   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/dashboard.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/dashboard.conf

9. Start Elasticsearch 

Start the Elasticsearch service and configure it to start automatically when 
the system is rebooted. 

.. code:: bash

   sudo service elasticsearch restart
   sudo update-rc.d elasticsearch defaults 95 10

10. Start the remaining services

.. code:: bash

   sudo freshclam
   sudo service clamav-daemon start
   sudo service gearman-job-server restart
   sudo service archivematica-mcp-server restart
   sudo service archivematica-mcp-client restart
   sudo service archivematica-storage-service restart
   sudo service archivematica-dashboard restart
   sudo service nginx restart
   sudo service fits restart

If you have trouble with the gearman command try this as an alternative:

.. code:: bash

   sudo restart gearman-job-server

11. Post Install Configuration

See :ref:`Post Install Configuration <post-install-config>`


.. _install-pkg-ubuntu:

Install CentOS/Redhat Packages
------------------------------

Archivematica version 1.5.1 and higher support installation on CentOS/Redhat.

1. Prerequisites

Update your system

.. code:: bash

   sudo yum update

2. Extra repos:

Some repositories need to be installed in order to fullfill the installation procedure:

* Extra packages for enterprise linux

.. code:: bash

   sudo yum install -y epel-release

* Elasticsearch

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u root rpm --import https://packages.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
   sudo -u root bash -c 'cat << EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/elasticsearch.repo
   [elasticsearch-1.7]
   name=Elasticsearch repository for 1.7 packages
   baseurl=https://packages.elastic.co/elasticsearch/1.7/centos
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=https://packages.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
   enabled=1
   EOF'

* Archivematica

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u root bash -c 'cat << EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/archivematica.repo
   [archivematica]
   name=archivematica
   baseurl=https://packages.archivematica.org/1.6.x/centos
   gpgcheck=0
   enabled=1
   EOF'

3. Service depencencies

Common services like elasticsearch, mariadb and gearmand should be installed 
and enabled before the archivematica install. It can be done with:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u root yum install -y java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless elasticsearch mariadb-server gearmand
   sudo -u root systemctl enable elasticsearch
   sudo -u root systemctl start elasticsearch
   sudo -u root systemctl enable mariadb
   sudo -u root systemctl start mariadb
   sudo -u root systemctl enable gearmand
   sudo -u root systemctl start gearmand

4. Install Archivematica Storage Service

* First, we install the packages:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u root yum install -y python-pip archivematica-storage-service

* After the package is installed, we need to populate the sqlite database, and 
  collect some static files used by django. 
  These tasks must be run as “archivematica” user.

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u archivematica bash -c " \
   set -a -e -x
   source /etc/sysconfig/archivematica-storage-service
   cd /usr/share/archivematica/storage-service
   /usr/lib/python2.7/archivematica/storage-service/bin/python manage.py migrate
   /usr/lib/python2.7/archivematica/storage-service/bin/python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ";

* And now, we enable and start the archivematica-storage-service and it’s nginx frontend

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u root systemctl enable archivematica-storage-service
   sudo -u root systemctl start archivematica-storage-service
   sudo -u root systemctl enable nginx
   sudo -u root systemctl start nginx

.. note::

   The storage service will be avaliable at http://<ip>:8001

5. Installing Archivematica Dashboard and MCP Server

* First, install the pacakges:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u root yum install -y archivematica-common archivematica-mcp-server archivematica-dashboard

* Create user and mysql database with:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -H -u root mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -e "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS MCP; CREATE DATABASE MCP CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;"
   sudo -H -u root mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -e "CREATE USER 'archivematica'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'demo';"
   sudo -H -u root mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -e "GRANT ALL ON MCP.* TO 'archivematica'@'localhost';"

* And as archivematica user, run migrations:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u archivematica bash -c " \
   set -a -e -x
   source /etc/sysconfig/archivematica-dashboard
   cd /usr/share/archivematica/dashboard
   /usr/lib/python2.7/archivematica/dashboard/bin/python manage.py syncdb --noinput
   ";

* Start and enable services:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u root systemctl enable archivematica-mcp-server
   sudo -u root systemctl start archivematica-mcp-server
   sudo -u root systemctl enable archivematica-dashboard
   sudo -u root systemctl start archivematica-dashboard

* Reload nginx in order to load the dashboard config file:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u root systemctl reload nginx

.. note::

   The dashboard will be avaliable at http://ip:81

6. Installing Archivematica MCP client

* First, we need to add some extra repos with the MCP Client dependencies:

* Archivematica supplied external packages:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u root bash -c 'cat << EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/archivematica-extras.repo
   [archivematica-extras]
   name=archivematica-extras
   baseurl=https://packages.archivematica.org/1.6.x/centos-extras
   gpgcheck=0
   enabled=1
   EOF'

* Nux multimedia repo

.. code:: bash

   sudo rpm -Uvh https://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-5.el7.nux.noarch.rpm

* Forensic tools repo

.. code:: bash

   sudo rpm -Uvh https://forensics.cert.org/cert-forensics-tools-release-el7.rpm

* Then, install the package:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u root yum install -y archivematica-mcp-client

* The MCP Client expect some programs in certain paths, so we put things in place:

.. code:: bash

   sudo cp /usr/bin/clamscan /usr/bin/clamdscan
   sudo ln -s /usr/bin/7za /usr/bin/7z

After that, we can enable and start services

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u root systemctl enable archivematica-mcp-client
   sudo -u root systemctl start archivematica-mcp-client
   sudo -u root systemctl enable fits-nailgun
   sudo -u root systemctl start fits-nailgun

7. Finalizing installation

**Configuration**

Each service have a configuration file in /etc/sysconfig/archivematica-packagename

**Troubleshooting**

If IPv6 is disabled, Nginx may refuse to start. If that is the case make sure that the listen directives used under /etc/nginx are not using IPv6 addresses like [::]:80.

CentOS will install firewalld which will be running default rules likely blocking ports 81 and 8001. If you are not able to access the dashboard and storage service, check if firewalld is running. If it is, you will likely need to modify the firewall rules to allow access to ports 81 and 8001 from your location.

8. Post Install Configuration

See :ref:`Post Install Configuration <post-install-config>`


.. _ansible-git-ubuntu:

Automated Ubuntu Github Install
-------------------------------

Installing from source has been tested using ansible scripts. Ansible 
installations have been tested for new installations but are not fully tested 
for upgrades.

These instructions are designed to create a test environment on your local 
machine.  A virtual machine running Ubuntu 14.04 will be created.  

It is assumed here that your host operating system is Ubuntu.  This can be 
modified for a different unix based operating system, such as Mac OS X or 
another linux distribution such as Centos.  These instructions will not
work if you are using Windows as the host OS.  For Windows installations
you can create a virtual machine and follow the manual install instructions.  

The ansible roles referenced here can be used in production deployments 
by creating your own ansible playbook to run them. See 
https://github.com/artefactual/deploy-pub/playbooks/archivematica for more 
details.

1. Install Dependencies

These instructions require VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Ansible

   .. code:: bash

      sudo apt-get install virtualbox vagrant
      sudo pip install -U ansible

   Vagrant must be at least version 1.5. Check your version with:

   .. code:: bash

      vagrant --version

   If it is not up to date, you can download the newest version from the 
   `Vagrant website <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>`_ .

2. Download Installer

Checkout the deployment repo:

   .. code:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/artefactual/deploy-pub.git

3. Dependencies

Download the Ansible roles:

   .. code:: bash

      cd deploy-pub/playbooks/archivematica
      ansible-galaxy install -f -p roles/ -r requirements.yml

4. Install

Create the virtual machine and provision it:

   .. code:: bash

      vagrant up

   .. warning::

     This will take a while.
     It depends on your computer, but it could take up to an hour.
     Your computer may be very slow while Archivematica is being provisioned - 
     be sure to save any work and be prepared to step away from your computer 
     while Archivematica is building.

5. Re-provisioning

If there's an error, you can re-run the setup.

   .. code:: bash

      vagrant provision

Once it's done provisioning, you can log in to your virtual machine::

  vagrant ssh

You can also access your Archivematica instance through the web browser:

* Archivematica: `<http://192.168.168.192>`_. Username & password configured on 
  installation.
* Storage Service: `<http://192.168.168.192:8000>`_. Username: test, password: 
  test.

6. Post Install Configuration

See :ref:`Post Install Configuration <post-install-config>`


.. _post-install-config:

Post Install Configuration
--------------------------

After successfully completing a new installation using one of the methods 
above, follow these steps to complete the configuration of your new server. 

1. Test the storage service

The storage service runs as a separate web application from the Archivematica 
dashboard. Go to the following link in a web browser and log in as user *test* 
with the password *test*: http://localhost:8000 (or use the IP address of the
machine you have been installing on).

2. New Storage Service User

Create a new administrative user in the Storage service. The storage service 
has its own set of users. In the User menu in the Administrative tab of the 
storage service, add at least one administrative user, and modify the
test user, to change the password at a minimum. After you have created 
an administrative user, copy its API key to your clipboard.

3. Test the dashboard 

You can login to the Archivematica dashboard and finish the installation in a 
web browser: http://localhost (again, use the IP address of the machine you 
have been installing on). When prompted, enter the URL of the Storage Service,
the name of the administrative user, and that user's API key.

4. Register your installation for full Format Policy Registry interoperability.

Follow the instructions in the web browser to complete the installation.

.. _upgrade:

Upgrade from Archivematica 1.5
==============================

Archivematica 1.5.x is available for Ubuntu 14.04 and Centos 7.x.  If you are
running a version of Archivematica older than 1.5.0, you will need to upgrade
your operating system from Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 14.04, and upgrade 
Archiveamtica to 1.5.1 before following these instructions.

* :ref:`Upgrade Ubuntu Package Install <upgrade-ubuntu>`
* :ref:`Upgrade CentOS/Redhat Package Install <upgrade-centos>`

While it is possible to upgrade a github based source install using ansible,
these instructions do not cover that scenario.

**Backup first**

Before starting any upgrade procedure on a production system, it is prudent to
back up your system.  If you are using a virtual machine, take a snapshot of it
before making any changes.  Alternatively, back up the file systems being used
by your system.  Exact procedures for updating will depend on your local 
installation.   At a minimum you should make backups of:

* the storage service sqlite database
* the dashboard mysql database

A simple example of backing up these two databases:

.. code:: bash

   sudo cp /var/archivematica/storage-service/storage.db ~/storage_db_backup.db
   mysqldump -u root -p MCP > ~/am_backup.sql

If you do not have a password set for the root user in mysql, you can take out
the '-p' portion of that command. If there is a problem during the upgrade
process, you can restore your mysql database from this backup and try the
upgrade again.

.. _upgrade-ubuntu:

Upgrade on Ubuntu
-----------------
 
1. Update OS 

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

2. Update pip

This is used to install python dependencies for both the storage service and 
the dashboard.  There is a _known issue: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-pip/+bug/1658844 with the version of pip installed on 
Ubuntu 14.04, which makes this step necessary.

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get install -y python-pip
   sudo pip install -U setuptools

3. Update Package Sources

.. code:: bash

   sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:archivematica/externals
   echo 'deb [arch=amd64] http://packages.archivematica.org/1.6.x/ubuntu trusty main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
   echo 'deb [arch=amd64] http://packages.archivematica.org/1.6.x/ubuntu-externals trusty main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list

Optionally you can remove the lines references packages.archivematica.org/1.5.x from /etc/apt/sources.list.

4. Update Archivematica Storage Services


.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install archivematica-storage-service

5. Update Application Container

Archivematica Storage Service 0.10.0 uses gunicorn as wsgi server. This means that the old uwsgi server needs to be stopped and disabled after perfoming the upgrade.

.. code:: bash

+   sudo service uwsgi stop
+   sudo update-rc.d uwsgi disable

6. Update Archivematica

During the update process you may be asked about updating configuration files.
Choose to accept the maintainers versions. You will also be asked about
updating the database, say 'ok' to each of those steps. If you have set a
password for the root mysql database user, enter it when prompted. It is
better to update the dashboard before updating the mcp components.

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get upgrade
   
7. Disable Unused Services

Archivematica 1.6.0 uses nginx as http server, and gunicorn as wsgi server. This means that some services used in Archivematica 1.5.0 should be stopped and disabled before performing the upgrade.

.. code:: bash

    sudo service apache2 stop
    sudo update-rc.d apache2 disable


8. Restart Services

.. code:: bash

   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/dashboard.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/dashboard.conf
   sudo service gearman-job-server restart
   sudo service archivematica-mcp-server restart
   sudo service archivematica-mcp-client restart
   sudo service archivematica-dashboard restart
   sudo service fits restart
   sudo freshclam
   sudo service clamav-daemon restart
   sudo service nginx restart

Note, depending on how your Ubuntu system is set up, you may have trouble
restarting gearman with the command in the block above.  If that is the case,
try this command instead:

.. code:: bash

   sudo service gearman-job-server restart

9. Remove unused services

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get remove --purge apache2 uwsgi

10. Known problems

Due to browser caches, there might be problems the first time you load Archivematica 1.6. You can clean your browser cache using Ctrl + Shift + R

.. _upgrade-centos:

Upgrade from Archivematica 1.5 for CentOS/Redhat
------------------------------------------------

* First, upgrade the repositories for 1.6:

.. code:: bash

   sudo sed -i 's/1.5.x/1.6.x/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/archivematica*

* Then, upgrade the packages:

.. code:: bash

   sudo yum update

* Once the new packages are installed, we need to upgrade the databases for both, archivematica and the storage service. This can be done with:

.. code:: bash

   sudo -u archivematica bash -c " \
   set -a -e -x
   source /etc/sysconfig/archivematica-storage-service
   cd /usr/share/archivematica/storage-service
   /usr/lib/python2.7/archivematica/storage-service/bin/python manage.py migrate
   /usr/lib/python2.7/archivematica/storage-service/bin/python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ";

   sudo -u archivematica bash -c " \
   set -a -e -x
   source /etc/sysconfig/archivematica-dashboard
   cd /usr/share/archivematica/dashboard
   /usr/lib/python2.7/archivematica/dashboard/bin/python manage.py syncdb --noinput
   ";

* After that, we can restart the archivematica related services, and continue using the system:

.. code:: bash

   sudo systemctl restart archivematica-storage-service
   sudo systemctl restart archivematica-dashboard
   sudo systemctl restart archivematica-mcp-client
   sudo systemctl restart archivematica-mcp-server

Docker installations are experimental at this time- instructions coming soon.

.. _development:

Install for development
-----------------------

The recommended way to install Archivematica for development is with Ansible and
Vagrant. For instructions on how to install Archivematica from a virtual machine,
see the `Ansible & Vagrant Installation instructions
<https://wiki.archivematica.org/Getting_started#Installation>`_ on the Archivematica
wiki.

.. _multiple-machines:

Installing across multiple machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to spread Archivematica's processing load across several machines by installing the following services on separate machines:

* Elasticsearch
* gearman
* mySQL

For help, send an email to `Archivematica tech mailing list. <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/archivematica-tech>`_


.. _firewall:

Firewall requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When installing Archivematica on multiple machines, all the machines must be
able to reach each other on the following ports:

* http, mysqld, gearman, nfs, ssh


.. _install-atom:

Using AtoM 2.x with Archivematica
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Archivematica 1.6 has been tested with and is recommended for use with AtoM
versions 2.2. AtoM version 2.2 or higher is required for use with the
hierarchical DIP functionality; see :ref:`Arrange a SIP from backlog <arrange-sip>`.

Installation instructions for Atom 2 are available on the
:ref:`accesstomemory.org documentation <atom:home>`. When following those
instructions, it is best to download Atom from the git repository (rather than
use one of the supplied tarballs). When checking out Atom, use the head of
either the stable/2.1.x, stable/2.2.x or qa/2.3.x branch (integration with qa branch is experimental).

Once you have a working AtoM installation, you can configure dip upload
between Archivematica and Atom. The basic steps are:

* Update atom dip upload configuration in the Archivematica dashboard

* Confirm atom-worker is configured on the Atom server (copy the atom-
  worker.conf file from atom source to /etc/init/)

* Enable the Sword Plugin in the AtoM plugins page

* Enable job scheduling in the AtoM settings page (AtoM version 2.1 or lower only)

* Confirm gearman is installed on the AtoM server

* Configure ssh keys to allow rsync to work for the archivematica user, from
  the Archivematica server to the Atom server

* Start gearman on the Atom server

* Start the atom worker on the AtoM server
