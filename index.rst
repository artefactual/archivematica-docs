Getting started
===============

The getting started manual is intended for users who are considering
implementing Archivematica as a digital preservation solution. This manual
includes information on the Archivematica project as well as a quick-start guide
to help new users test it out. For information about installing and using
Archivematica in a production environment, see the user or administrator manuals
below.

.. _home-overview:

Overview
--------

The overview section provides a definition of Archivematica and a description of
the OAIS model on which it is based, its technical architecture, the
microservices framework, and information about system requirements for deploying
Archivematica.

Quick-start guide
-----------------

This section is intended to introduce prospective users to Archivematica for
testing purposes, using either the Archivematica sandbox or a local virtual
machine. This is not a guide to installing Archivematica for development or
production - please see the :ref:`Administrator manual <admin-manual-home>` for
full installation instructions.

User manual
===========

The user manual is intended for archivists, librarians, and other users who
interact with Archivematica through the web-based user interface. The user
manual is organized based on the tabs in the Archivematica UI.

.. _home-transfer:

Transfer
--------

The Transfer tab is the place where an Archivematica transfer begins. Along with
the transfer widget, this tab displays microservices and jobs that act upon
content to prepare your transfer to become a SIP (submission information
package).

* :ref:`ContentDM (transfer and ingest) <contentdm>`
* :ref:`Scan for viruses <scan-for-viruses>`

.. _home-backlog:

Backlog
-------

The Backlog tab displays content that has been added to the Archivematica
backlog and allows users to search, download and delete transfers from the
backlog location.

The Appraisal and Arrangement tab is used to analyze and arrange material which
has been placed in backlog. It can also be used to arrange materials directly to
resources in ArchivesSpace.

* :ref:`General description <appraisal>`
* :ref:`Transfers in the Backlog <backlog_pane>`
* :ref:`Analysis <analysis_pane>`
* :ref:`File List <File_list_pane>`

* :ref:`Arrangement <arrangement>`

.. _home-ingest:

Ingest
------

The Ingest tab displays the microservices and jobs that take place to turn a
SIP into an AIP or a DIP. This tab also contains the backlog widget.

Archivematica pipeline and related metadata such as size of AIP, UUID and date
stored.

.. _home-preservation:

Preservation planning
---------------------

The Preservation Planning tab is the de facto user interface for the Format
Policy Registry (FPR), the extensive format database that controls how
Archivematica handles file formats. The Preservation Planning tab allows users
to add or edit format policies for normalization, characterization, validation,
and other tools and workflows that act upon content preserved through
Archivematica.
