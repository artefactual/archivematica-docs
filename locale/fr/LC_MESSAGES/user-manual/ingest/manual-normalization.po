"The manual normalization feature allows the user to prepare transfers "
"that already contain manually normalized files. The user adds a "
"/manualNormalization folder and its subdirectories to the transfer prior "
"to processing. Archivematica recognizes that this folder already exists "
"and will not add one during processing. This workflow requires that there"
" must be a one-to-one relationship between the transfer and the SIP."

"First, create your transfers with a structure that mimics the one in this"
" sample. Name the /topDirectory whatever you want (you can still change "
"this when you upload the transfer to the dashboard) and place the "
"original files in it. /manualNormalization contains two directories, "
"/access and /preservation which include in them the files you've already "
"normalized for access and/or preservation prior to transfer. In the "
"sample shown here, file1.tga has a manually normalized preservation "
"version (file1.tif) and a manually normalized access version (file1.jpg)."
" Note that the filenames, in this instance \"file1\", MUST match in order"
