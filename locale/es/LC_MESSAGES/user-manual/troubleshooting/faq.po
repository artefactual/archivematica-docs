"**What technical skills are required to install/maintain/operate "
"Archivematica?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user-manual/troubleshooting/faq.rst:9
msgid ""
"To install and maintain Archivematica successfully, you or someone in "
"your organization should be comfortable using and maintaining Linux-based"
" servers, logging in to the server and performing operations via the "
"command line. This individual should also be able to read and understand "
"and/or research errors in Linux based systems to assist with "
"troubleshooting."

msgid ""
"Operating Archivematica takes place in a web-based dashboard so an "
"archivist/librarian/curator does not necessarily need to have the same "
"skill set described above, so long as someone in their organization is "
"able to provide technical support. Some familiarity with `OAIS "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System>`_ will "
"make Archivematica more intuitive to use but is not necessarily a "
"prerequisite."

"Organizations that are unable to provide in-house technical support may "
"consider a `maintenance contract "

"Systems."

msgid "**Does Archivematica perform fixity checks?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user-manual/troubleshooting/faq.rst:28
msgid ""
"Archivematica generates checksums upon transfer of objects into the "
"system, and will verify those checksums before storing the AIP. It is "
"also possible to include :ref:`pre-existing checksums <transfer-"
"checksums>`, which Archivematica will also verify."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user-manual/troubleshooting/faq.rst:33
msgid ""
"To check fixity of AIPs in storage, Artefactual has written a separate "
"command-line app called `Fixity <https://github.com/artefactual/fixity>`_"
" (further user documentation for Fixity is pending)."

msgid "**Is Archivematica a storage system?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user-manual/troubleshooting/faq.rst:39
msgid ""
"Archivematica is purposefully designed to be storage system agnostic, "
"leaving the door open for integration with a wide variety of existing "
"storage systems."

msgid ""
"**What is the Archivematica Storage Service and why is there a separate "
"application?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user-manual/troubleshooting/faq.rst:44
msgid ""
"The Archivematica Storage Service manages the storage and transfer source"
" locations for Archivematica installations. Our recommendation is for "
"each institution to have one or two administrators who are responsible "
"for managing the Storage Service and restrict access to only those "
"individuals. This is one of the reasons why it is maintained as a "
"separate application; another reason is so that multiple Archivematica "
"pipelines can be managed through one Storage Service."

"**Why doesn't Archivematica have a module for providing access to digital"
" materials?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user-manual/troubleshooting/faq.rst:55
msgid ""
"In a manner of speaking, it does! It's called :ref:`AtoM <atom:home>` and"
" it is another open-source, freely available software application managed"
" and developed by Artefactual Systems. Archivematica and AtoM are "
"developed in conjunction with one another, and you can send access copies"
" from Archivematica to AtoM, while maintaining a link between your "
"preservation copies and the access copies. AtoM can also be used to "
"manage archival descriptions for all of your digital and analogue "
"material, so your users do not have to consult multiple systems to do "
"their research."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user-manual/troubleshooting/faq.rst:64
msgid ""
"We recognize that you may wish to use a different access system than "
"AtoM, which is why we have developed workflows with CONTENTdm, Islandora,"
" DSpace, Archivist's Toolkit and ArchivesSpace, for example. Other "
"integrations are possible; see the next question below."

"If you have software development skills, consider writing to code "

"Archivematica is a complex piece of software with many dependencies, all "
