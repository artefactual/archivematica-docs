"Archivematica's primary preservation strategy is to normalize files to "
"preservation and access formats upon ingest. The preservation copies are "
"added to the AIP and the access copies are used to generate a DIP for "
"upload to the access system. Note that the original files are always "
"kept, to allow for different preservation actions in the future, such as "
"normalization to different archival formats or emulation."

"Not all digital objects can be normalized on ingest. For example, for "
"some digital objects like CAD drawings or Microsoft Visio files there are"
" no available Linux-based open-source tools to handle the conversions "
"and/or no agreed upon preservation formats. In addition, some formats "
"such as Microsoft Word documents are not necessarily in the best "
"preservation format but are still so ubiquitous and well-supported that "
"they need not be normalized at the present time. In these cases, the "
"Archivematica default is to keep them in their original formats; format "
"risk assessment and information received from our users over time will "
"allow Artefactual to expand the defaults over time to include more "
"formats via the :ref:`Format Policy Registry (FPR) <fpr>`."
