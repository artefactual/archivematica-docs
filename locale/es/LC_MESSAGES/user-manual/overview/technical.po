"Archivematica implements a micro-service approach to digital "
"preservation. The Archivematica micro-services are granular system tasks "
"which operate on a conceptual entity that is equivalent to an OAIS "
"information package: Submission Information Package (SIP), Archival "
"Information Package (AIP), Dissemination Information Package (DIP). The "
"physical structure of an information package will include files, "
"checksums, logs, submission documentation, XML metadata, etc."

"The web dashboard allow users to process, monitor and control the "
"Archivematica workflow processes. It is developed using Python-based "
"Django MVC framework. The Dashboard provides a multi-user interface that "
"will report on the status of system events and make it simpler to control"
" and trigger specific micro-services. This interface allows users to "
"easily add or edit metadata, coordinate AIP and DIP storage and provide "
"preservation planning information. Notifications include error reports, "
"monitoring of MCP tasks and manual approvals in the workflow."

"Archivematica maintains the original format of all ingested files to  "
"support migration and emulation strategies. However, the primary "
"preservation strategy is to normalize files to preservation and access "
"formats upon ingest. Archivematica groups file formats into format "
"policies (e.g. text, audio, video, raster image, vector image, etc.). "
"Archivematica's preservation formats must all be open standards. "
"Additionally, the choice of formats is based on community best practices,"
" availability of free and open-source normalization tools, and an "
"analysis of the significant characteristics for each media type. The "
"choice of access formats is based largely on the ubiquity of web-based "
"viewers for the file format."

"Since the 1.0 production release, Archivematica format policies have been"
" moved to a structured, online format policy registry (FPR) that brings "
"together format identification information with significant "
"characteristic analysis, risk assessments and normalization tool "
"information to arrive at default preservation format and access format "
"policies for Archivematica."

"The primary function of Archivematica is to process digital transfers "
"(accessioned digital objects), turn them into SIPs, apply format policies"
" and create high-quality, repository-independent Archival Information "
"Packages (AIP) using `METS <http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/>`_, "
"`PREMIS <http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/>`_ and `Bagit "
"<https://confluence.ucop.edu/download/attachments/16744580/BagItSpec.pdf?version=1>`_."
" Archivematica is bundled with `AtoM <http://www.accesstomemory.org>`_ "
"but is designed to upload Dissemination Information Packages (DIP), "
"containing descriptive metadata and web-ready access copies, to any "
"access system (e.g. Dspace, ContentDM, etc.)."

"Using the latest in virtualization technology, each release of the "
"Archivematica system packages a customized Xubuntu environment as a "
"`virtual appliance <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_appliance>`_, "
"making it possible to run on top of any consumer-grade hardware and "
"operating system. This means the entire suite of digital preservation "
"tools is now available from one simple installation. Archivematica can "
"also be installed directly on dedicated hardware via its own Ubuntu "
"repository. Its client/server processing architecture allows it to be "
"deployed in multi-node, distributed processing configurations to support "
"large-scale, resource- intensive production environments."
