"The goal of the Archivematica project is to give archivists and "
"librarians with limited technical and financial capacity the tools, "
"methodology and confidence to begin preserving digital information today."
" The project has conducted a thorough OAIS use case and process analysis "
"to synthesize the specific, concrete steps that must be carried out to "
"comply with the OAIS functional model from Ingest to Access. Through "
"deployment experiences and user feedback, the project has expanded even "
"beyond OAIS to address analysis and arrangement of transferred digital "
"objects into SIPs and allow for archival appraisal at multiple decision "
"points. Wherever possible, these requirements are assigned to software "
"tools within the Archivematica system. If it is not possible to automate "
"these steps in the current system iteration, they are incorporated and "
"documented into a manual procedure to be carried out by the end user. "
"This ensures that the entire set of preservation requirements is being "
"carried out, even in the early, pre 1.0 system releases. In short, the "
"system is conceptualized as an integrated whole of technology, people and"
" procedures, not just a set of software tools. For institutions that want"
" technical assistance to install and customize Archivematica, optional "
"technical support services are provided by Artefactual Systems."
